# sector-overview

**English companion of `README.md` (Chinese primary; the pair is for reading inside the repository — skill-channel pages do not resolve relative links, so this is deliberately not a clickable switch).**

*Full English translation of the Chinese-authoritative `README.md` in this directory; the Chinese text governs where the two diverge.*

"This sector is recovering." — on what evidence?

Most sector reports can't answer that: verdicts fly, and nowhere in the text is a comparable series cited. This piece does the opposite: **give it an industry name + a window, get back a six-section brief (≤6 pages) in which every verdict word (rising / falling / recovering / under pressure are common examples — which words count is set by the checker as it now stands, not by this list) carries, in the very same sentence, the series it relies on** (an `S<n>` anchor with basis and as-of date) — and every sentence that can't, honestly reads "no comparable series, no conjuncture judgement". Thin is fine. Unanchored verdicts are not.

**Input**: an industry (a Shenwan/CITIC first-tier industry name — 一级行业 — or a colloquial name; ambiguity → candidate list, never a guess) + window (default: last 4 complete quarters) + optional focus
**Output**: `sector-<industry>-<window>/` — `report.md` (portrait & takeaways / volume-price & drivers / supply-demand & capacity / landscape & representatives / policy timeline / review checklist) · `sources.jsonl` · ledger
**Cost**: five stages + four gates; ≤1 deep-research run (cost reported and asked before firing); expectation averages off by default

---

## 1. How the suite splits

| You want | Use |
|---|---|
| A four-quarter evidence brief on one industry (every verdict cite-able on the spot) | **this skill** |
| A deep earnings review of one company | `cn-earnings-note` |
| A 30-second one-pager before a client meeting | `tear-sheet` |
| Dated events for your holdings | `catalyst-calendar` |
| "Which sector should I like" | Nowhere — ratings are zero-tolerance here, **with no exemption zone** |

## 2. Why it's worth it (three hard lines)

- **Verdict-anchor co-location is the lifeblood, and literally gate ②**: which words count as verdict words is not listed here — **the judgement is the union of `JUDGE_PHRASE` and `JUDGE_SINGLE` as they currently stand in `check_sector.py`** (the English words above translate common examples; the machine matches the Chinese strings, examples are not exhaustive — one command prints the live sets, see §5) ⇒ a hit must carry `S<n>` in the same sentence, or the sentence must be the verbatim second-state line (a reworded one still fails while it keeps a verdict word or a second-state hint; a hedge carrying neither is invisible to the machine and sits in the human-review lane) — an unanchored verdict is, by this suite's definition, a hallucination (the sector analogue of the sister ticket's invented dates);
- **No recycled templates**: each run first derives 2–4 analysis dimensions for *this* industry via one deep-research pass (hogs look at inventory, PV looks at production schedules) — the framework is asked anew, never memorized;
- **Association-sourced numbers all carry confidence tier L3 (research-second-hand)** and land in the review checklist; sector-mean expectation data is off by default (high-risk oversell, refused at the source).

## 3. Quick start (three steps)

1. **Install**: `npx skills add huhoo/cue-awesome --skill sector-overview` — that command installs this package; afterwards list your installed skills again and seeing `sector-overview` there is what proves the files landed. Dropping this directory into your agent's skills folder works the same way.
2. **Ask**: "光伏行业近况盘一下，重点看排产和价格" (Chinese or English triggers). ≤3 questions to align inputs.
3. **Collect**: after `+scope → +series → +research → +policy → +companies`, `check_sector.py` runs four gates — **no delivery without passing**. The gate script and its guard samples both ship in the package; **the word sets and the guard count are self-checked by running them, not quoted here** (two commands in §5), and the real smoke's shape lessons were back-locked as guard samples.

## 4. First-time Cue setup (three steps, skippable)

Install the evidence legs: `cue-data-mcp` / `cue-research` (`cue-omni-reader` as needed) — these ship in Cue's official skill collection (sensedeal): the whole set `npx skills add sensedeal/cue-skills` (it lists what is published there; pick what to install), or one at a time `npx skills add sensedeal/cue-skills --skill cue-data-mcp`, swapping the last name for `cue-research` or `cue-omni-reader`. This package itself is installed by the command in the section above (`huhoo/cue-awesome --skill sector-overview`) — do not conflate the two.
Register at <https://cuecue.cn> (new accounts get 500 credits at signup and 10 credits daily — server policy governs) → get `CUE_API_KEY` at <https://cuecue.cn/hub/api-key> into your local credential facility (**never paste it into chat**, and do not echo it in a terminal).
The three layers prove different things and are not interchangeable: **skill installed ≠ credentials configured ≠ channel connected**. Installed means the names above show up when you list your installed skills again (files landed, nothing more). Credentials configured means that key exists in your local facility — **present is not accepted**, and acceptance only becomes judgeable in the next layer. Connected means you reached the target domain with that key following the `url` inside its own `routing` (`Authorization: Bearer <$CUE_API_KEY>`, plus `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` — missing that header gives a 406, protocol behaviour, not an authentication failure) **and** `tools/list` returned; tool names and schemas follow that response's current values. An anonymous `GET` of the `CATALOG` defined in the block returning anything proves only that the **catalog is reachable** — this package does not call that "connected", and a connection error is not "the domain has no data": report it as-is.

```bash
CATALOG="https://cuecue.cn/api/mcp-catalog"
curl -s "$CATALOG" | python3 -c 'import json,sys
rows=json.load(sys.stdin)["data"]["domains"]
[print(r.get("id"), r.get("external_status"), (r.get("routing") or {}).get("url", "-")) for r in rows]'
DOMAIN_ID="<replace with one of the ids listed by the line above>"
ROUTING_URL="$(curl -s "$CATALOG" | python3 -c 'import json,sys
rows=json.load(sys.stdin)["data"]["domains"]
hit=[r["routing"]["url"] for r in rows if r.get("id")==sys.argv[1] and r.get("routing")]
print(*hit,sep="\n") if hit else sys.exit("Not found: that id is not in the catalog response (or its routing has no url field) - run the line above and pick one of the ids listed")' "$DOMAIN_ID")"
[ -n "$ROUTING_URL" ] || { echo "Fetch failed: ROUTING_URL is empty - run the line above, then set DOMAIN_ID to one of the ids listed" >&2; exit 1; }
curl -s -X POST "$ROUTING_URL" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CUE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' \
  -w '\nHTTP %{http_code}\n'
```

Where the value comes from: `$ROUTING_URL` is fetched by the two lines above from the anonymous catalog response - the verbatim `url` field inside that domain's `routing` object, never a hardcoded domain or path; `CATALOG` in the block is the only catalog-entry literal on this face (assigned once, not restated in prose); `$CUE_API_KEY` comes from the local credential facility set up in the layer above, never enters chat, is not echoed in a terminal, and this block adds no new credential-reading step.
Pass = HTTP 200 with a non-empty `result.tools` in the body (recognised by shape only, e.g. `{"result":{"tools":[…]}}`; this face lists no tool names and promises no counts).
One precision note about the live reply: this endpoint may answer in SSE form (an event line followed by a data line), and the result.tools to look for lives inside that data payload - the verdict is unchanged, the body is just wrapped one layer deeper.
One-command form (no need to edit the line inside the block): `cd sector-overview && python3 -B scripts/cue_connectivity_check.py --domain <your domain id> --post`. This shipped script sends nothing by default - without --post it only fetches the url inside that domain routing and shows it to you. To see which ids exist, run the same script with `--list` first (it lists domains and urls, no POST). This script sets up no second criterion, 4 means connectivity is not proven yet (rerun with --post), 5 means it connected but the live values did not satisfy it, 1 means nothing could be fetched, nothing could be sent, or the HTTP layer itself reported an error (4xx and 5xx included), 6 means the destination failed the two credential-egress gates - nothing was sent and not one credential byte was attached, 7 means the catalog entry itself was not https. On the default catalog entry this script only checks runtime-endpoint connectivity - it publishes nothing to any channel and creates no acceptance record. **A swapped source is not exempt from the check**: whether that url came from the default catalog, from --catalog-url or from the --catalog-file snapshot, the request carrying the key must first pass the same two gates - the scheme must be https, and the host must match an authorized suffix (the default one is derived from the catalog entry in this script header, not a list invented here; pass --allow-host to authorize another). If it does not pass, the script refuses and prints the reason together with that host, and it neither reads the key nor builds the request. The cost is stated in the same breath: the old "whatever the swapped source hands over gets dialled" behaviour is closed off, and what you get in exchange is credentials that never leave toward an unauthorised destination - if your legitimate endpoint sits outside the suffix, exit 6 is the script asking you to confirm it with --allow-host, not a claim that endpoint should not exist.

It runs without Cue too (paste association reports; lines marked user-supplied) — but the anchor discipline doesn't relax: only material that can actually anchor a verdict may carry one.

## 5. What's in the package

```
SKILL.md                         master instruction: lifeblood rule / input contract / pipeline / output / suite linkage (must read)
README.md / README.en.md         this pair (Chinese source of truth / English translation)
CHANGELOG.md                     version history
references/section-skeleton.md   six sections with an [执行蓝图] each
references/policy-timeline.md    policy-timeline row spec (the statute three-part anchor spec lives in this file; machine check = `STATUTE_SPEC_RE` as it now stands)
scripts/check_sector.py          four gates (word sets and guard inventory = the script and fixtures as they now stand; run the two lines below)
                                 note: which words count as verdict words, and which words are banned, is never listed in full here — the judgement is the checker as it now stands, self-checkable from any directory (the command carries the installed path):
                                     grep -n -A3 "JUDGE_PHRASE = \|JUDGE_SINGLE = \|BANNED_RE = \|GUESS_RE = " ~/.workbuddy/skills/sector-overview/scripts/check_sector.py
                                     bash ~/.workbuddy/skills/sector-overview/scripts/run_fixtures.sh (guard inventory and pass state, run in this package)
                                     Installed elsewhere: replace ~/.workbuddy/skills/ with your own skills directory; on Windows: C:\Users\<username>\.workbuddy\skills\sector-overview\scripts\check_sector.py
                                     Both lines use POSIX tooling (grep / bash) — on Windows run them in Git Bash or WSL. The first prints those four word-set definitions with context: the rule source itself, not a per-sentence classifier;
                                     the only carve-out the machine makes is the "not investment advice" disclaimer phrase itself (gate ③); a reworded second-state sentence still fails while it keeps a verdict word or a hint token, and one that keeps neither is invisible to the machine. Word examples here are not an exhaustive claim.
```

## 6. FAQ and anti-patterns (what you try to do -> this skill refuses, because -> where to go instead)

Reviewed iron rules and boundary clauses re-assembled. The authoritative word sets (judgement, banned,
speculation families) and anchor shapes are whatever `check_sector.py` holds now - locator command in section 5.

| What you try | Does it work, and why not | Where to go instead |
|---|---|---|
| Say plainly whether the sector is buyable | **No.** That word family has zero exemption - no column exception, no "just verbally" exception | This ships industry heat evidence with comparable-series anchors; the verdict stays human |
| Keep words like recovery / pressure / inflection without an anchor | **No.** Anchor co-location on the same line is the lifeblood - that is literally gate two | Write it only after fetching a comparable series on the spot; otherwise drop to the thin-report state, never substitute stale values |
| Patch a number you cannot fetch on the spot with hedging phrasing | **No.** Missing data is declared, not filled | Data-gap declaration plus a line on the review checklist |
| Apply one fixed industry framework to every sector | **No.** No framework library is carried; dimensions are generated per industry type by the research run (2-4) | Accept dynamic dimensions; a canned framework is a different product |
| Nothing has a series on record, but ship the full six sections anyway | **No.** The legal shape is an empty conclusion | Thin report plus why it is thin; padding is exactly what the gate blocks |
| Also cover one specific name's recent heat | **Out of scope** (subject here is the industry) | `tear-sheet` for a one-pager, `cn-earnings-note` for an earnings note |

## 7. When something goes wrong (symptom -> cause -> recovery)

**Whatever is absent from this run's tool output is written as "not found"**: a parameter, field or enum value that does not appear there must not be filled from memory - write "not found" and log it on the pending or coverage list; a blank never stands in for it.

**Error-level findings are blockers**: never describe them as harmless, ignorable, or shippable-as-is - fix them, or declare them explicitly on the deliverable.

Shapes are taken from **the current output** of `check_sector.py`, captured by running it: on failure one line `FAIL: <file> (N items)`; detail lines **start with an error-code prefix (one of the five `E-*` codes), then the check label** (`[E-FORMAT] [参数] (args)`, `[E-BANWORD] [3]`, `[E-ANCHOR] [2]`, `[E-FORMAT] [4]` and so on), then the line number and that check's spec; the final `code legend:` line lists only the codes used. A clean pass prints `PASS: <file> (four gates passed: declaration / lifeblood / banned words / format)`.

The five codes are a closed, suite-wide identical set (byte-identical with the four siblings): `E-FORMAT` / `E-ANCHOR` / `E-BANWORD` / `E-COVERAGE` / `E-LEDGER`. Handling is printed in the `code legend:` line, and the label-to-code mapping for this package is the classifier inside the script - one line from anywhere, swapping these two keys into the grep in section 5:

    grep -n "^E_LEGEND\|^E_RULES" ~/.workbuddy/skills/sector-overview/scripts/check_sector.py

| Symptom (detail prefix) | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `[E-FORMAT] [参数] (args) missing --window(...)` | The formal command requires the window (anti wall-clock) | Add `--window YYYY-MM-DD~YYYY-MM-DD`, matching the declared window verbatim |
| `[E-FORMAT] [①] / [④] ...` | The declaration block is missing, or the six-section shape, table columns or row order are off | Restore per the bracketed spec; the shape is fixed, do not add or drop sections |
| `[E-ANCHOR] [②] ...` | The lifeblood rule was not kept: a heat claim with no comparable series anchor on the same line | Attach the series fetched on the spot (domain + value + period), or rewrite the sentence as a declaration or data gap |
| `[E-FORMAT] [④] sources line N field ... missing or empty` (same family: id not S<n>, kind/confidence outside the enum, illegal asof) | The evidence ledger is malformed | Repair that `sources` line per the bracketed spec; research items need `conv_id` plus the saved path |
| `[E-BANWORD] [③] line N ...` | A word from the banned set entered the body (rating, price-target, buy/sell families) | Rewrite neutrally or delete; no exemptions - full word set via section 5's locator |
| `[E-COVERAGE] [④] line N numeric/series row unanchored ... (缺数须申报)` | A row carries numbers with no `[S<n>]` anchor and no declared gap | Add the anchor, or rewrite the row as a declared data gap - never substitute stale values |
| `[E-ANCHOR] [④] 正文孤儿锚:S<n> 在 sources 不存在（④双向账）` / `[E-ANCHOR] [④] 法定锚不可核:statute ...` | An anchor in the body has no ledger entry, or a statutory anchor cannot be verified | Book the `sources` line with its raw snapshot; statutory anchors need name + article number + short quote, all three, or delete the row |
| Evidence directory missing or hash mismatch | Evidence is fail-closed | Restore the raw snapshots and re-book; delete the claim if it cannot be evidenced |
| Association or domain data stopped inside the window | No update for the period - a data shape, not a script error | Declare the gap and hang it on the review checklist; report research cost before spending it |
| A traceback instead of `FAIL ... (N items)` | An incident: the gate is defined zero-crash with every parse point wrapped | Stop and report with the exact command; run section 5's guard samples to tell a bad report from a broken script |

## 8. How to ask (three positive examples, one counter-example)

**Ask with a point in time; the output states its data date**: give the reporting period, reference date or look-back window in the request; the deliverable labels its **data date** on the first line, and when that differs from the date you asked about, the text never says "today" or "latest" - it reads "as of <date>".
- **Positive (industry + angle)**: "Review the photovoltaic sector lately, focus on production plans and prices" -
  the shape in section 3; at most three questions fill the contract (industry / window / angle).
- **Positive (ambiguous industry name, disambiguated first)**: "How did the consumer electronics chain do in H1?" -
  "consumer electronics" can mean panels, devices or components, so candidates are listed and you choose; the skill
  never guesses for you, and the window then defaults to the last four complete quarters, echoed back.
- **Positive (multi-angle + explicit window + policy anchor requirement, complex input)**: "Construction machinery,
  window 2025-01-01~2026-06-30, three angles: operating hours, excavator sales, export mix; in the policy section
  keep only anchors fetched on the spot with name + article number + short quote all three present" - anything less
  is not entered, and one line of refusal reasoning goes to `progress.md`.
- **Counter-example (adjacent need, not this skill)**: "one-pager on CATL recently" - `tear-sheet`; "deep-dive note
  for 2026 Q2" - `cn-earnings-note`; "lay out anchored public risk facts for these names" - `dd-checklist`.

## 9. Current status (the blunt list)

- **Building-materials half-course run landed (2026-09-21)**: 1 research run (~13 min) + 7 direct lookups + 0 omni; portrait/volume-price/supply-demand moved from all-second-state to line-by-line sourcing (research-second-hand rows all carry tier L3 and sit in the review checklist). **Single authoritative count for the whole repo, scope fixed: the volume-price & drivers section holds 6 table rows, each carrying both a scope column and its source anchor — that number is this section's row count only, not the report-wide sourced-row count and not the L3-tier count.** Competing asphalt quotes from two sources stay un-arbitrated by design; continuous weekly series remain unavailable (five "not found" rows on record): **a half-course anchor pass ≠ a claimable price/volume series capability**; dimension quality stays a design value;
- **capability state**: public with the repo (current version per this package's `CHANGELOG.md` and frontmatter); **a full end-to-end delivery run has not landed** (the half-course run and the smoke are both ≠ full delivery) — until it does, section coverage, runtime and dimension quality stay design values and are not claimed as verified;
- **Listing status (version-scoped)**: **version 0.1.4 was submitted with the repo-wide first listing and accepted by the skillhub channel** (all seven in that batch were accepted, this package among them); **the current version has no acceptance record in this ledger, so nothing here claims it is live** - which version is on the shelf follows the channel's receipt, and this face names only the version that has a record. Inside the repository, visibility follows the root README and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- no charts (tables carry as-of dates); no market-data flow, no expectation means; companies appear only as anchored aggregates, never as commentary.

## 10. Sources & credit

- Base: anthropics/financial-services `sector-overview` (Apache-2.0) — origin of the six-section task shape.
- This package is an **A-share re-implementation, not a port**: the verdict-anchor rule, dynamic dimensions, and policy-anchor format are this suite's own discipline. No code from the base. See the repo-root `NOTICE.md`.
