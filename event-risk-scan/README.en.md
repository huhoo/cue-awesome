# event-risk-scan · Company Risk Scan

**Give it one company, get one page you can trace back: penalties and regulatory measures line by line with document number, date and authority; external guarantees as a proxy surface, honestly labelled; a sanctions-enforcement surface when the entity crosses borders; and every surface the channel cannot reach named as "not reached" - no gaps filled in, no scores.**

It does not rate overall risk, does not compute default probability, and is not investment advice. The job here is the half that can be evidenced: lay out what was retrieved, and state plainly what was not. Capability: three surfaces are reachable - penalties and regulatory measures, external guarantees (a proxy surface), and global sanctions enforcement; three are out of scope - litigation, equity chain and supply-chain contagion, each named on the card rather than filled in.

**Input**: a company name or its six-digit code (one entity per card)
**Output**: a filled `assets/风险扫描卡.md` - subject row, penalty and measure table, guarantee points, sanctions surface, unreached-and-pending list
**Cost**: the three sources run independently; one failing does not block the rest; whatever came back is what gets listed
**Machine face**: `scripts/check_scan_card.py`, four lanes (shape / anchor / red line / count-and-declaration), zero network

---

## 1. Do this when you open it: three steps today

These three are the only "do it now" in this package; each step says what breaks if you skip it. The first sentence can be copied verbatim: **"Scan this company's penalties, regulatory measures and external guarantees, and name the unreached surfaces."**

| Step | Action | How | What breaks if you skip it |
|---|---|---|---|
| ① | **Settle the subject, copy the returned fields** | Give a name or six-digit code; the company name and code come **only from this run's tool output**; when several candidates return, list them and let the user pick - this package never picks for them | A wrong primary key hangs every later item on the wrong company; a cross-domain unified subject ID does not work, so the six-digit code plus per-domain disambiguation is the only followable shape |
| ② | **Run the three sources one by one, anchor every row** | Penalties and measures: document number / date / authority / reason sentence, all verbatim, plus the official link; guarantees: proxy surface, one `as_of` per row; sanctions: only when the entity crosses borders, and query both the short and the full name | An item without provenance is not an item; querying one name shape alone can turn "the full name matched nothing" into "it was never listed" |
| ③ | **Write all three time marks, then run the gate** | Header needs data date, window start-end and run time (missing any one voids the card), each in date form; then `python3 scripts/check_scan_card.py my-card.md` and fix detail lines by their `E-*` codes | Without time marks "nothing found in the window" and "never looked" collapse into each other; the gate exists precisely to block that collapse |

The three unreached surfaces (litigation / equity chain / supply-chain contagion) sit **outside** these steps: this package has no leg there, so the card names them in part five - it does not query them, infer them, or substitute web search.

## 2. The five parts and the four lanes

| Part | Content | What the gate enforces |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Subject row | Company name / six-digit code (from this run's output) plus the candidate-handling tick | Value without provenance -> `E-ANCHOR`; candidate handling not ticked exactly once -> `E-COVERAGE` |
| 2 Penalty and measure table | Per row: document number or title / date / authority / reason sentence / official source | Missing date -> `E-ANCHOR`; a source cell with neither link nor document-number anchor -> `E-ANCHOR`; zero rows without a ticked "not found in window" declaration -> `E-COVERAGE` |
| 3 Guarantee points | Proxy surface; every row carries `as_of` and provenance; zero rows still get named | Missing `as_of` or provenance -> `E-ANCHOR`; unticked 0-row declaration, a placeholder `as_of`, or no "truly none vs extraction gap - undistinguished" note -> `E-COVERAGE` |
| 4 Sanctions surface | Runs only for cross-border entities; hits carry `document_number` or URL; a miss states the window | Missing date or anchor -> `E-ANCHOR`; surface status ticked other than exactly one, a miss without a window, or a run without the name-shape declaration -> `E-COVERAGE` |
| 5 Unreached and pending | All three surfaces named one by one; human items under `[待人工]` | A missing face or unticked status -> `E-COVERAGE`; an unreached face claiming a leg without this run's provenance -> `E-BANWORD` (a fabricated leg) |

The header has its own hard set: **the three self-labels** (`AI 整理初稿`, `请回官方原文核对`, `不构成投资建议`) **plus the three time marks** - data date, window, run time; missing any one voids the card, and each must land in date form. Anything absent or still a placeholder is an `E-FORMAT`. The gate checks the **shape** of a date (year-month-day forms), not the calendar: `2026-02-30` and `2026-13-01` pass the shape check, and both `~` and `～` work as window separators - even a doubled `~~` raises no error. Whether the calendar is valid and whether that window really is those days rests on the returned source: take it back to the official text. A gate PASS is not a calendar check.

## 3. Getting started

```bash
# 1. Put it in the skills directory
mkdir -p ~/.workbuddy/skills
cp -r event-risk-scan ~/.workbuddy/skills/

# 2. Copy the card template and fill it following section 1
cp ~/.workbuddy/skills/event-risk-scan/assets/风险扫描卡.md ./my-card.md

# 3. Run the gate (no network)
python3 ~/.workbuddy/skills/event-risk-scan/scripts/check_scan_card.py ./my-card.md
```

Read `assets/风险扫描卡.md` first (that is the five-part shape), then `SKILL.md` §2 for the contract itself.

### Self-check

```bash
python3 scripts/check_scan_card.py --help                        # usage; no network
python3 scripts/check_scan_card.py --selftest                     # good sample must pass, bad sample must fire all four lanes, the single-point counter-example must fire and name which endpoint is broken
python3 scripts/check_scan_card.py scripts/fixtures/good-scan-card.md    # should PASS
python3 scripts/check_scan_card.py scripts/fixtures/bad-scan-card.md     # should FAIL, all four codes
python3 scripts/check_scan_card.py scripts/fixtures/mut-window-tbd-card.md                               # should FAIL: the window end date replaced by a placeholder; the finding names the broken endpoint
python3 scripts/check_scan_card.py assets/风险扫描卡.md                    # should FAIL - a blank card failing the gate is the design, not a defect
```

**Take every count from the script's own report line** (`FAIL: … (N items)` and the `扫过 N 行，发条 0 条` line under `PASS:`); this file does not restate them - a restated count becomes a second source of truth and drifts on every script change. **Two line-count conventions**: `扫过 N 行` counts `split('\n')` elements, which is `wc -l` **+1** (the trailing newline occupies one); report the convention together with the number.

### First-time Cue setup (three steps, skippable)

This package has one evidence leg: retrieval across penalty, regulator-measure, guarantee and sanctions domains (data-mcp).
**Not installing raises no error** - without the channel the scan card can still be filled by hand and pass the same format gate - what the checker actually enforces is: an empty penalty table must tick the windowed "not found" declaration and an empty guarantee face must tick the "0 rows" declaration; **separating "not run" from "not reached" is a human check - the gate does not judge that state**. What you lose is coverage and traceability.

1. Register at <https://cuecue.cn> (new accounts get 500 credits at signup and 10 credits daily - the server-side policy governs);
2. Get `CUE_API_KEY` at <https://cuecue.cn/hub/api-key> and store it in your local credential facility - **never paste it into chat**; the agent never handles the key;
3. Install the one skill(s) this package's evidence legs use: `cue-data-mcp` - the scan card's domain routing and lookups depend on it. All of them ship in Cue's official skill collection (sensedeal); one command, two forms:
   - whole set: `npx skills add sensedeal/cue-skills` (it lists the skills published in that collection; pick what to install);
   - one at a time: `npx skills add sensedeal/cue-skills --skill cue-data-mcp`.

   Afterwards check three separate things, because they are not the same fact: **skill installed ≠ credentials configured ≠ channel connected**.
   - installed: list your installed skills again and the names from the command above show up (this only proves the files landed, not that data flows);
   - credentials configured: the `CUE_API_KEY` from step 2 exists in your local credential facility - never paste its value into chat and do not echo it in a terminal;
   - connected: connect to the target domain with that key following the `url` inside its own `routing` (`Authorization: Bearer <$CUE_API_KEY>`, plus `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` - missing that header gives a 406, protocol behaviour, not an authentication failure; the key from the layer above merely being present says nothing about whether it is accepted - that becomes judgeable only here) **and** `tools/list` returns. How to ask: send a JSON-RPC `tools/list` request to the address that domain's `routing` gives you. What counts as passing: HTTP 200 and a non-empty `result.tools` in the body (verbatim shape `{"result":{"tools":[...]}}`, tool names and input schemas inside it) - **the tool list follows that response's current values; this package promises no specific set of tools and hardcodes no tool names**. An anonymous `GET` of the `CATALOG` defined in the block returning on the spot proves only that the **catalog is reachable** - this package does not call that "connected": it yields each domain's `external_status` and the live domains' `routing`, and a domain missing from it stays uninstalled and unpromised here. A connection error is not "the domain has no data": report it as-is and retry only what the error marks as retryable.

   ```bash
   CATALOG="https://cuecue.cn/api/mcp-catalog"
   curl -s "$CATALOG" | python3 -c 'import json,sys
   rows=json.load(sys.stdin)["data"]["domains"]
   [print(r.get("id"), r.get("external_status"), (r.get("routing") or {}).get("url", "-")) for r in rows]'
   DOMAIN_ID="<replace with one of the ids listed by the line above>"
   ROUTING_URL="$(curl -s "$CATALOG" | python3 -c 'import json,sys
   rows=json.load(sys.stdin)["data"]["domains"]
   hit=[r["routing"]["url"] for r in rows if r.get("id")==sys.argv[1] and r.get("routing")]
   print(*hit,sep="\n") if hit else sys.exit("Not found: that id is not in the catalog response (or its routing has no url field) - run the line above and pick one of the ids listed")' "$DOMAIN_ID")"
   [ -n "$ROUTING_URL" ] || { echo "Fetch failed: ROUTING_URL is empty - run the line above, then set DOMAIN_ID to one of the ids listed" >&2; exit 1; }
   curl -s -X POST "$ROUTING_URL" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $CUE_API_KEY" \
     -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' \
     -w '\nHTTP %{http_code}\n'
   ```

   The routing placeholder in this block is filled by the two lines above, fetched live from the anonymous catalog response - the verbatim url field inside that domain's routing object; CATALOG in the block is the only catalog-entry literal on this face (assigned once, not restated in prose). This face hardcodes no domain or path; the credential variable comes from the local key established in the layer above (never into chat, never echoed in a terminal), and this block adds no new credential-reading step. The pass verdict stays exactly as written there; this block does not set up a second one.
   One precision note about the live reply: this endpoint may answer in SSE form (an event line followed by a data line), and the result.tools to look for lives inside that data payload - the verdict is unchanged, the body is just wrapped one layer deeper.
   One-command form (no need to edit the line inside the block): `cd event-risk-scan && python3 -B scripts/cue_connectivity_check.py --domain <your domain id> --post`. This shipped script sends nothing by default - without --post it only fetches the url inside that domain routing and shows it to you. To see which ids exist, run the same script with `--list` first (it lists domains and urls, no POST). This script sets up no second criterion, 4 means connectivity is not proven yet (rerun with --post), 5 means it connected but the live values did not satisfy it, 1 means nothing could be fetched, nothing could be sent, or the HTTP layer itself reported an error (4xx and 5xx included), 6 means the destination failed the two credential-egress gates - nothing was sent and not one credential byte was attached, 7 means the catalog entry itself was not https. On the default catalog entry this script only checks runtime-endpoint connectivity - it publishes nothing to any channel and creates no acceptance record. **A swapped source is not exempt from the check**: whether that url came from the default catalog, from --catalog-url or from the --catalog-file snapshot, the request carrying the key must first pass the same two gates - the scheme must be https, and the host must match an authorized suffix (the default one is derived from the catalog entry in this script header, not a list invented here; pass --allow-host to authorize another). If it does not pass, the script refuses and prints the reason together with that host, and it neither reads the key nor builds the request. The cost is stated in the same breath: the old "whatever the swapped source hands over gets dialled" behaviour is closed off, and what you get in exchange is credentials that never leave toward an unauthorised destination - if your legitimate endpoint sits outside the suffix, exit 6 is the script asking you to confirm it with --allow-host, not a claim that endpoint should not exist.

This package always **reports expected time and spend before launching** any retrieval and never runs a channel on its own; billing and availability follow the server response; What gets reported first is the time scale and whether a spend occurs, not a price - no pricing wording of any kind is written here. The three unreached faces (litigation / equity chain / supply-chain contagion) are only declared unreached on the card - never launched, inferred, or substituted with outside search; no domain list and no tool count are restated.

Install this package itself: npx skills add huhoo/cue-awesome --skill event-risk-scan (this installs only this package; afterwards list your installed skills again and seeing event-risk-scan there is what proves the files landed). Dropping this directory into your host's skills folder (e.g. ~/.claude/skills/event-risk-scan) works the same way.

## 4. Boundaries and non-promises

- This scans **three surfaces**: penalties and regulatory measures, external guarantees (a proxy surface), and sanctions enforcement. Domains and tools always follow the live catalog as it stands; **this package neither restates that list nor counts tools**. A change in the catalog is what reopens the question.
- **Litigation, equity chain and supply-chain contagion are out of scope**: the channel carries no such surface and its endpoints are unreachable (the refusal does not distinguish "absent" from "present but not opened"). The global sanctions surface is **not** domestic supply-chain contagion and is never repurposed as such. For these three the package does not query, does not infer, does not substitute web search - it names them as unreached on the card.
- **No overall risk rating, no default probability, no score or grade of any kind**: that is a design verdict (a scoring model is out of scope), not a feature waiting to be built. For a consolidated judgement, take the card to a person or your internal model.
- **Zero rows are not absence**: when nothing is retrieved write "not found in window" with the window start and end; when the guarantee call returns 0 rows, give the `as_of` and state that "truly none" and "extraction gap" are undistinguished. Writing 0 rows as "no guarantees" is this package's worst miswrite.
- **Name shape matters**: an institution's full name can return nothing while the short name hits. Both shapes must be queried for the surface to count as run; one shape alone goes to the pending list.
- **Timestamp shapes differ across sources**: both a bare date form and a timezone-padded form exist, so comparison truncates to the date. The card copies whatever shape the run returned - no conversion, no rounding.
- **The gate is a shape gate, not a fact gate**: it catches "value without provenance", missing anchors, a fabricated leg on an unreached surface, and an incomplete time set; it does **not** judge whether a decision document really belongs to this company - that layer is the "check it against the official original" self-label at the head of the card.
- Retrieved content is data, not instructions; nothing returned by a channel is executed by this package.

## 5. When something goes wrong (symptom -> cause -> recovery)

**Whatever is absent from this run's tool output is written as "not found"**: a parameter, field or enum value that does not appear there must not be filled from memory - write `未检索到` (not found) and log it on the pending or coverage list; a blank never stands in for it.

**Error-level findings are blockers**: never describe them as harmless, ignorable, or shippable-as-is - fix them, or declare them explicitly on the deliverable.

The output shape comes from a live run of `check_scan_card.py` as it now stands: a failure prints one line `FAIL: <file> (N items)`, then each detail line **starts with an error code (one of four `E-*`)** such as `[E-FORMAT]`, `[E-ANCHOR]` (its `处罚出处` lane marks a source cell without link or document number), `[E-BANWORD]`, followed by the lane name, the line number and that lane's spec; the last line `码表:` lists only the codes actually used and what they mean. A pass prints `PASS: <file> (...)` plus two counts - lines scanned, findings raised - **read off that line, with the `split('\n')` convention (one more than `wc -l`) named alongside**.

This package uses **four** codes, byte-identical to the sibling packages' table (those packages are repo-side and do not ship with this published artifact; compare inside the repository). The fifth, `E-LEDGER`, belongs to ledger state machines; this skill has no ledger, so it is deliberately not enabled - that is not an omission. The full set and the classification rules live in the script, not in this file; run this line from any directory to locate them:

    grep -n "^E_LEGEND" ~/.workbuddy/skills/event-risk-scan/scripts/check_scan_card.py

| Symptom (detail prefix) | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `[E-FORMAT]` header or time lanes | One of the three self-labels missing; or data date / window / run time absent, still a placeholder, or not in date form | Complete the header - the three time marks are all-or-nothing, and they are written from this run, never backfilled |
| `[E-FORMAT]` section lanes | A part is missing or out of order | Restore the order from section 2; keep the template's section names verbatim, because renaming them hides the section from the gate |
| `[E-ANCHOR]` subject, penalty, guarantee or sanction lanes | A row has content but no provenance, link, document-number anchor or date from this run | Copy the provenance into the right cell; **if you cannot, delete the row** and record "not found in window" instead of guessing |
| `[E-BANWORD]` red-line lane | A grade, rating, default probability or score was written; or an assertive "no risk", "never been checked", "unified ID" | Return to neutral statements: list retrieved items and name unreached surfaces. Negated disclaimers ("does not rate", "does not compute") are legal; assertive violations must go |
| `[E-BANWORD]` fabricated-leg lane | An unreached surface was ticked as "has a leg" without this run's provenance | Tick "channel unreached"; if there genuinely is new evidence, attach this run's link or date and wait for a domain re-check account |
| `[E-COVERAGE]` zero-row, status, window, name-shape, candidate or three-face lanes | Zero rows without a ticked declaration; a declaration lacking its window or `as_of`; a status group ticked other than once; multiple candidates not named; a face missing from the unreached list; no `[待人工]` roll-up | Tick and fill: declarations need their dates; statuses need exactly one tick; all three faces need naming; restore the roll-up |

## 6. How to ask (three positive examples plus one counter-example)

**Ask with the window and the subject shape**: name the company (or its six-digit code), say how long a window you want, and require the unreached surfaces to be named.

| Positive example | What you get |
|---|---|
| "Scan this company's penalties and regulatory measures for the last three years, one document number and link per row" | Parts one and two: a settled subject row plus verbatim items with dates and official sources |
| "How much of the external guarantee picture can you get? Say so even when it is zero rows" | Part three: the proxy surface, and a 0-row declaration carrying `as_of` and the "truly none vs extraction gap" caveat |
| "Will sanctions lists hold back this company's overseas business? Check short and full names" | Part four: hits with `document_number` / URL, or a miss written up with its window and the store-side declaration |
| **Counter-example: "just give me a risk grade and a buy/no-buy call"** | Not done here. Grades, scores and default probability are a designed-out surface; take the card to a person or your internal model for a conclusion |

## 7. Capability boundaries (honest list)

- The five-part contract, the four lanes and three fixtures are all in place (good, one counter-example per lane, and a single-point counter-example where only the window endpoint is broken); the good sample's finding count and the bad sample's four-lane firing are **read off the script's own line**, not restated here.
- **Three surfaces are scanned and no more**: penalties and regulatory measures, external guarantees (proxy surface), global sanctions enforcement. Litigation, equity chain and supply-chain contagion are outside this package and get named face by face on the card.
- **No hit-rate, pass-rate or timing figure**, and never "scanned, therefore clear". How many items appear is whatever this run returned; a wrong primary key voids the whole card (primary-key rule in section 1, step 1).
- **Guarantees are a proxy surface, not the guarantee record itself**: the envelope carries its own `as_of` snapshot note, and zero rows still self-report the time point - but "truly none" versus "extraction gap" cannot be self-proven upstream, so the card must carry it as pending.
- Domain lists, tool counts and field names follow this run's catalog and output; nothing is restated or hardcoded here.

## 8. Dependencies

- `python3` (only `scripts/check_scan_card.py`; standard library, zero network, sends no request)
- The data legs are platform retrieval channels (domains follow the live catalog). Without a channel the template can still be filled by hand and pass the same shape gate - but the gate only enforces the windowed "not found" tick on an empty penalty table and the "0 rows" tick on an empty guarantee face; ticking "not run" apart from "not reached" is a human check the gate does not judge, never merged into one claim.

## 9. Resources

| `SKILL.md` | Main instructions and the five-part contract (design authority, Chinese primary) |
| `assets/风险扫描卡.md` | Five-part scan card template (fill it) |
| `scripts/check_scan_card.py` | Four-lane gate (shape / anchor / red line / count and declaration) |

| `scripts/fixtures/bad-scan-card.md` | Bad-sample fixture (one counter-example per lane) |
