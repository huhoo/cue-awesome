# tear-sheet

**English companion of `README.md` (Chinese primary; the pair is for reading inside the repository — skill-channel pages do not resolve relative links, so this is deliberately not a clickable switch).**

*Full English translation of the Chinese-authoritative `README.md` in this directory; the Chinese text governs where the two diverge.*

**Thirty seconds before a client meeting — enough?** Enough. Hand it an issuer + a use case and you get a one-page sheet where **every line traces to a disclosure anchor** (readable on one screen) — and an opinions column that honestly stays blank.

This is the suite's **lowest-barrier entry piece**: zero deep research by default, built on structured-disclosure lookups, per-run cost magnitude has no measured evidence (consumption is whatever the server returns; the page header prints this run's channel usage). It does not decide for you; it lays out what is certain within 30 seconds — three identity lines, a four-period snapshot (cumulative + single-quarter, basis-tagged), on-record events (only those with an explicit disclosed date), risk items that actually hit, and three `[待人工]` slots for a human's view.

**Input**: issuer(s) (official name or code, ≤5) + purpose (pre-meeting glance / client brief) + optional one-line focus
**Output**: `tearsheet-<date>-<n>issuers/` — `page.md` (the five-block sheet) · `sources.jsonl` · `progress.md` ledger
**Cost**: three stages + one format gate; 0 research runs by default, at most one billing confirmation across the whole flow

## 1. What it is / what it isn't

| You want | Use |
|---|---|
| A 30-second pre-meeting one-pager (every line anchored) | **this skill** |
| A dated calendar of upcoming events for your holdings | sibling `catalyst-calendar` |
| A deep earnings review or quarter-over-quarter ledger | sibling `cn-earnings-note` |
| Spreadsheet deliverables, batches of >5 issuers, ratings / target prices / buy-sell advice | No — the opinions block is literally three blank lines waiting for a human |

## 2. The format *is* the discipline (why it looks like this)

Five blocks in fixed order; three header declarations mandatory (generation asof / data cutoff / this run's channel usage). These are gate checks, not aesthetics:

- **every line anchors**: only the **last column** of the snapshot table is validated, and it must match the `ANCHOR_OK_RE` whitelist as it now stands (announcement index / URL / domain ref / `[S<n>]` and kin); that whitelist accepts bare numeric strings of six-plus digits (index and issuer-code shapes), "so a number on the page" is not "an anchored line" — what you verify is whether that column leads back to a disclosure;
- **events pass a gate first**: on-record events reuse the first-gate contract in `catalyst-calendar/references/event-taxonomy.md` by reference (cited, never copied — no second source of truth); the estimated-date word family is `ESTIMATE_RE` as it now stands in `check_page.py` (common examples get caught, the list here is not exhaustive) — "events" without an explicit disclosed date never reach the page;
- **no fake all-clears**: if the direct lookup hits nothing, the page must carry the fixed line "no hits within the direct-lookup surface ≠ no exposure";
- **better empty than invented**: an unresolvable line is deleted and logged — an empty line is legal, an invented line is not.

## 3. Quick start (three steps)

1. **Install**: put this directory into your agent's skills folder.
2. **Ask**: "见客户前给我一页纸看看东方雨虹" or "客户简报里加一节美的" (Chinese or English triggers). ≤3 questions to align inputs.
3. **Collect**: after three stages, `check_page.py` runs four gates (declarations / column anchors + two-way sources / zero-tolerance word list / format & line budget) — **no delivery without passing**.

## 4. First-time Cue setup (three steps, skippable)

Register at <https://cuecue.cn> (new accounts get 500 at signup and 10 daily — server policy governs) → get `CUE_API_KEY` at <https://cuecue.cn/hub/api-key> into your local credential facility (**never paste it into chat**) → install `cue-data-mcp` (`cue-omni-reader` as needed).
It runs without Cue too (you paste disclosure text; the page marks lines as user-supplied) — but then you don't see what anchored channel lookups actually look like, which is precisely what this piece is meant to show.

## 5. What's in the package

```
SKILL.md          master instruction: input contract / five blocks / cost discipline / pipeline & gate / boundaries (must read)
README.md         this file (Chinese source of truth)
README.en.md      English translation
CHANGELOG.md      version history
scripts/          gate script check_page.py + fixtures (word sets and guard inventory = the script and fixtures as they now stand; run the two lines below)
                                 note: which words are banned, which count as estimates, and which shapes pass as anchors is never listed in full here — the judgement is the checker as it now stands, self-checkable from any directory (the command carries the installed path):
                                     grep -n -A3 "BANNED_RE = \|ESTIMATE_RE = \|ANCHOR_OK_RE = \|PERIOD_RE = \|BASIS_ENUM = " ~/.workbuddy/skills/tear-sheet/scripts/check_page.py
                                     bash ~/.workbuddy/skills/tear-sheet/scripts/run_fixtures.sh (guard inventory and pass state, run in this package)
                                     Installed elsewhere: replace ~/.workbuddy/skills/ with your own skills directory; on Windows: C:\Users\<username>\.workbuddy\skills\tear-sheet\scripts\check_page.py
                                     Both lines use POSIX tooling (grep / bash) — on Windows run them in Git Bash or WSL. The first prints those five shape definitions with context: the rule source itself, not a per-sentence classifier;
                                     the anchor whitelist does accept bare six-plus-digit strings, so "a number on the page" is not "an anchored line". Word examples here are not an exhaustive claim.
```

## 6. FAQ and anti-patterns (what you try to do -> this skill refuses, because -> where to go instead)

Reviewed boundary clauses and fixture shapes re-assembled, nothing new promised. The banned family, the
speculation family and anchor shapes are whatever `check_page.py` holds now (locator command in section 5).

| What you try | Does it work, and why not | Where to go instead |
|---|---|---|
| Let me fill the view section myself so the page reads client-ready | **No.** The view section is three deliberately empty lines; filling them is out of bounds | A person writes the view; this skill keeps each figure traceable to a filing |
| Also export an Excel / spreadsheet file | **No.** Output is a markdown client page only | Build the spreadsheet yourself; no file format grows into this shape |
| Do seven or eight issuers in one pass | **No.** Issuers capped at 5 (machine-checked); beyond that per-row anchors slip | Run batches; to watch dates across a holdings set use `catalyst-calendar` |
| Fill a missing cell from common sense | **No.** That row is deleted and logged as a dropped row - empty is legal, invented is not | Leave the gap and log one line; add the row when the disclosure arrives |
| Put upcoming event dates into the one-pager | **No.** This page carries filed history only; forward-looking dates belong to the calendar skill | Use `catalyst-calendar`, where every event carries a disclosure anchor |
| Ask for live market values (price, daily change) | **Not included.** That channel is not open and this package never promises unopened domains | Pull quotes from your own terminal; this page stays on disclosure terms |

## 7. When something goes wrong (symptom -> cause -> recovery)

Shapes are taken from **the current output** of `check_page.py`, captured by running it: on failure one line `FAIL: <file> (N items)`; detail lines **start with an error-code prefix (one of the five `E-*` codes), then the check label** (`[E-FORMAT] [参数] (args)`, `[E-BANWORD] [3]`, `[E-ANCHOR] [2]`, `[E-FORMAT] [4]`), then the line number and that check's spec; the final `code legend:` line lists only the codes used. A clean pass prints `PASS: <file> (four gates passed, subject blocks scanned normally)`.

The five codes are a closed, suite-wide identical set (byte-identical with the four siblings): `E-FORMAT` / `E-ANCHOR` / `E-BANWORD` / `E-COVERAGE` / `E-LEDGER`. Handling is printed in the `code legend:` line; the label-to-code mapping for this package is the classifier in the script, printable from anywhere by swapping these two keys into the grep in section 5:

    grep -n "^E_LEGEND\|^E_RULES" ~/.workbuddy/skills/tear-sheet/scripts/check_page.py

| Symptom (detail prefix) | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `[E-FORMAT] [参数] (args) missing --subjects(...)` | The formal command requires the declared subject count (two-way alignment with the page) | Add `--subjects N` equal to the real number of subject blocks; the opposite mismatch is reported too |
| `[E-FORMAT] [①] / [④] ...` | The first-screen declaration is missing, or the five blocks, section names, columns or row order are off (renaming or adding/removing sections triggers it) | Restore per the bracketed spec - the fixed risk sentence must be present |
| `[E-ANCHOR] [②] anchor empty / not in the accepted set` | The row has no anchor that resolves to a filing, or its shape is not accepted | Attach a disclosure anchor in an accepted shape (announcement index / document number / URL) or delete the row; never invent one |
| `[E-BANWORD] [③] line N hit ...` | A word from the banned set entered the body (rating, price-target, buy/sell families) | Rewrite neutrally or delete; no exemptions - full word set via section 5's locator |
| `[E-COVERAGE] [④] --subjects 声明 N ≠ 机检主体数 M(少报多搭/顶替申报)` | The declared subject count disagrees with the subject blocks actually on the page | Set `--subjects` to the real block count; do not resize the blocks to fit the declaration |
| Channel missing / a value cannot be fetched | Tool absent, or that measure was not disclosed for the period | Degradation: user-supplied material (marked at its source level); drop the row and log it instead of substituting an estimate |
| A traceback instead of `FAIL ... (N items)` | An incident - the gate is defined zero-crash with every parse point wrapped | Stop and report with the exact command; run section 5's guard samples to separate a bad page from a broken script |

## 8. How to ask (three positive examples, one counter-example)

- **Positive (single issuer)**: "Give me a one-pager on Oriental Yuhong before the client meeting" - the shape in
  section 3; at most three questions fill the contract (subject / purpose / focus).
- **Positive (multiple issuers + purpose + focus + output dir)**: "Two names tomorrow: Midea and CATL. Purpose is a
  pre-credit conversation; one page each, focus on cash flow and backlog wording, output to `~/sheets/2026-10/`" -
  each page keeps its own anchors and ledger, and the declared subject count must match.
- **Positive (with a one-line focus)**: "Give me a one-pager on Midea before the client meeting, focus on how cash
  flow has been" - the focus only promotes that topic to a bolded line inside the page; it introduces no new data
  source and no new section (it is the optional third question of the input contract; the format does not change).
- **Counter-example (adjacent need, not this skill)**: "tabulate the confirmed dates for these names over the next
  three months" - `catalyst-calendar`; "lay out public risk facts and account for what could not be checked" -
  `dd-checklist`. This one ships a filed-history one-pager.

## 9. Current status (the blunt list)

- **Five-issuer boundary run landed (2026-09-21)**: pre-meeting glance ×5 issuers, 26 data-mcp lookups, 0 research, 0 omni; check_page in full form (incl. `--subjects 5`) PASSed first pass with exit 0.
- **Capability state**: public with the repo (current version per this package's `CHANGELOG.md` and frontmatter); the gate script and its guard samples ship together and **the word sets and guard count are self-checked by running them, not quoted here** (two commands in §5). **The "30 seconds" claim has no measured evidence**, and no per-run cost magnitude is stated — time depends on your channels and consumption is whatever the server returns.
- **Not submitted to any skill market**: publishing (P2) remains frozen; timing is the Owner's call. Repo visibility is governed by the root README and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Issuer cap of 5 (machine-checked); no market-data flow (the `equity_market` channel is not open); **rating vocabulary is zero-tolerance by gate design** — the concept does not exist on this page.

## 10. Sources & credit

- Base: anthropics/financial-services `tear-sheet` (Apache-2.0) — the origin of the one-pager task shape.
- This package is an **A-share re-implementation, not a port**: the data layer is fully Cue-native; the five blocks, dual-basis snapshot, event first-gate, and cost discipline are rebuilt to this suite's contracts. No code from the base. See the repo-root `NOTICE.md`.
