# long-doc-translation

**English companion of `README.md` (Chinese primary; the pair is for reading inside the repository — skill-channel pages do not resolve relative links, so this is deliberately not a clickable switch).**

Turn a several-hundred-page foreign-language monograph into a **deliverable, verifiable, terminologically consistent** Chinese full manuscript.

## Open it and work: three steps today

First, what this package is actually for: not "translate a passage", but keeping 100+ translation units consistent in style and wording, so that after merging there are no duplicates, no broken joins and no untranslated leftovers. The three steps below exist for that, and each says what skipping it costs.

| Step | Action | How | What happens if you skip it |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Size the job first, then scaffold** | `python scripts/init_project.py <project-dir>` builds the chunk and style skeleton; under 10 pages the scale routing says **do not use this package** (configuration costs more than it returns), and a few dozen pages handled solo runs in `--scale light` | Scaffolding without sizing means running an 800-page rig over 8 pages - the cost lands on the pipeline, not on the translation |
| 2 | **Run `overlap_check.py` after slicing and before translating** | Slice along the book's own structure (chapter / page range) with **exactly one owner per chunk**, run `overlap_check.py`, only then start batching | A superset and its subset both get translated and the same passage appears twice - this package names that as an anti-pattern, and it is the most expensive kind of rework |
| 3 | **Pass two gates before merging, then build the reader** | `dedup_boundary.py` clears 1-2 paragraphs of boundary overlap, `qa_check.py` checks leftovers, duplicated passages and marginal-page continuity, `merge_build.py` emits the catalogued main draft and reading version | Discovering breaks after the merge means reworking all 100+ units at once; the gates' judgement and thresholds are whatever the scripts now say (see the grep in Getting started) |

**The first step never waits on anything**: sizing and scaffolding need no external service and no network.

## Pipeline

parse → clean & slice → build style guide + glossary → parallel batched translation → multi-dimensional QA → merge into a reading edition with a table of contents

## Fit

- Scholarly monographs, classics, archives and translated works over 300 pages (German / English / French / Japanese …)
- When you need consistent terminology book-wide, preserved footnotes, and traceable doubtful spots

## Dependencies

- `python3` + `markdown` + `pypinyin` (core scripts run fully offline)
- omni-reader (optional: stage one "parse" converts PDF / images to text)

## Scripts (`scripts/`)

`init_project.py` · `dedup_boundary.py` · `overlap_check.py` · `qa_check.py` · `merge_build.py` · `build_reader.py` · `_common.py`

## Specs (`references/`)

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `pitfalls.md` | Five pitfalls: detection / fix / prevention, including **silent script failure modes** |
| `qa-checklist.md` | Seven QA criteria + script thresholds + fixes + delivery baseline |
| `reader-build.md` | Engineering decisions and dependency degradation for the enhanced reader HTML |
| `parallel-translation.md` | Chunking rules, three must-haves for sub-agent prompts, acceptance checks |

## Getting started

```bash
python scripts/init_project.py --help        # of the six scripts, only this one accepts --help
python scripts/qa_check.py                  # the others print their usage when run bare (missing args exit 1, not a crash)
python scripts/build_reader.py               # these two carry default paths: a missing directory **errors out with checks to try**
# Measured: a nonexistent directory always exits 1 with guidance — it never prints "0 segments" and a row of green ticks.
```

See [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) for the full flow, hard rules and measured parameters; see [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) and the `SKILL.md` header for the current version — **this file states no version number** (one written here would be lying forever).

One command prints the constants the three QA scripts actually judge with, including their per-project "change this here" CONFIG blocks, runnable from any directory:

```bash
grep -n "CONFIG\|^[A-Z_]\{2,\} *=" ~/.workbuddy/skills/long-doc-translation/scripts/qa_check.py ~/.workbuddy/skills/long-doc-translation/scripts/overlap_check.py ~/.workbuddy/skills/long-doc-translation/scripts/dedup_boundary.py
```

#### Two starting tiers: simple and complex

- **Simple tier (one text, clean text layer, relaxed terminology)**: `python scripts/init_project.py <project dir>` builds the skeleton, put the source where the RUNBOOK says, then run parse -> clean & slice -> translate -> merge -> the three QA checks. For a few dozen pages done by one person the size-routing table in `SKILL.md` says use **light mode** (`--scale light`); the same table says plainly that a few pages (< 10) should **not** use this pipeline - configuration costs more than it saves.
- **Complex tier (columns, figure captions, scans, terminology unified across the book)**: parse first (an OCR channel such as omni-reader), slice by the book structure (chapter / page range, each segment belonging to exactly one place); then `overlap_check.py` (**before** translating - a superset and its subset each translated once duplicate the passage), `dedup_boundary.py` (clear 1-2 segment overlaps at neighbour boundaries), `qa_check.py` (completeness and style before merge). The only measured book is Dilthey, *Life of Schleiermacher* vol. 2: German, 800+ pages, 141 segments, 32 boundary seams - **wall-clock time was never measured here, so no hours are promised**; estimate by segment and batch count. Columns and figures are handled as text segments; thin text inside images may be missed, and the three QA scripts report untranslated residue, duplicated segments and page-mark gaps (thresholds via the grep line above, live values).

The gates come in two kinds: **fixed in-package gates** (a missing directory errors out rather than printing zero segments, segment-count reconciliation, TOC depth, page-number continuity) and **project-configured domains** (page-mark regex, the OCR typo table, the three note section names, which files/sections are skipped, grouping patterns and the default thresholds). Every number in this file, in `SKILL.md` and in `references/qa-checklist.md` is a mirror and a common example, **not an exhaustive claim** — the scripts as they now stand govern.

## FAQ and anti-patterns (what you try -> this skill declines, because -> where to go)

Reviewed hard rules, the size-routing table and the pitfalls document re-assembled; nothing new promised. Thresholds
and check lists stay in the scripts as they now stand (grep line above).

| What you try | Declined? Why | Where instead |
|---|---|---|
| Run this pipeline over a dozen paragraphs | **Discouraged.** The routing table says: under 10 pages the configuration costs more than it saves | Translate directly; this package exists for "hundreds of pages + terminology unified book-wide + verifiable" |
| A typeset bilingual parallel edition | **Not produced.** Output is a single-language master plus a reading HTML | That row is in the routing table; parallel typesetting is out of scope |
| Slice a scanned image straight in | **No.** No text layer, nothing to verify | Parse/OCR into a text layer first; if a parallel foreign edition exists, use it |
| Ignore overlapping slice boundaries and de-duplicate after translating | **Anti-pattern.** A superset and subset each translated once duplicate whole passages, hardest to see after merging | Run `overlap_check.py` **before** translating; `dedup_boundary.py` for what already happened |
| One global find-and-replace for OCR typos | **Anti-pattern.** Bulk replacement also rewrites our own translator notes | Scope the mapping to source text; the damage shape is pitfall 2 |
| Judge size and duplication by byte count | **Anti-pattern.** Bytes mixed with characters misjudge identical passages | Count characters; see pitfall 4 |
| Merge and ship subagent output unchecked | **No.** Parallel work is fine; unverified work is not | Each batch passes the QA checks before merging (batch discipline in `parallel-translation.md`, pitfall 5) |
| Emit the HTML while the `markdown` dependency is missing | **Cannot.** The .md master still builds; the HTML fails | The scripts name the install command and state the degradation instead of failing silently |

## When something goes wrong (symptom -> cause -> recovery)

**Whatever is absent from this run's tool output is written as "not found"**: a parameter, field or enum value that does not appear there must not be filled from memory - write "not found" and log it on the pending or coverage list; a blank never stands in for it.
Written from the **current actual output** of these scripts: none of them throws a traceback. A bad or missing path
prints `[出错] <cause>` (the bracketed tag is Chinese in the shipped text) followed by lines starting
`→ · <fix suggestion>` and exits 1 - measured behaviour: a missing directory always exits 1 with those hints and never
"prints zero segments then a row of greens"; running without arguments prints that script's usage block.

| Symptom | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `[出错] 目录不存在：<path>` with three `→ ·` hints | Path misspelled, a relative path taken against the shell rather than the project, or the project was never built | Work the hints in order: check spelling and current directory, quote paths containing spaces, and if unset `python scripts/init_project.py <project dir>` |
| Running with no arguments just prints usage | **By design**: a missing argument exits 1 rather than crashing | Read the required arguments in that usage block; re-run with the path and `--expect` |
| The same passage appears twice after merging | Sliding-window slices overlapped; superset and subset were each translated | `overlap_check.py` before translating, `dedup_boundary.py` after, then merge; reconcile seam counts against the measured shape |
| Odd words appear inside translator notes | The global OCR typo map rewrote our own text | Restrict the mapping to source scope, re-run the cleaning step, hand-correct contaminated notes |
| Page marks `[S. XXX]` break or stop being contiguous | Slice boundaries and page seams | Repair at the positions `qa_check.py` names; judge seams and suspects one by one (thresholds are live values) |
| A segment was skipped leaving no trace | Skip ranges (preface, appendix, figure pages) configured against a different real structure | Check the project-configured skip list and grouping pattern - that domain is per project, not a fixed in-package gate |

## How to ask (three positive examples, one counter-example)

**Ask with a point in time; the output states its source edition and translation date**: give the reporting period, reference date or look-back window in the request; the deliverable labels its **source edition and translation date** on the first line, and when that differs from the date you asked about, the text never says "today" or "latest" - it reads "as of <date>".
- **Positive (whole book)**: "Translate this 300-page German monograph into a Chinese master draft, terminology unified
  book-wide, with a verifiable master and a reading HTML" - the main scenario, full pipeline; pass `--expect` with an
  expected segment count so the QA checks reconcile against it.
- **Positive (complex: scan + columns + per-chapter batches)**: "Source is `~/book/dilthey-v2.pdf`, a scan with columns
  and figure captions. Cut batches by chapter, each subagent translates exactly one chapter and may not restructure;
  run overlap detection before merging - at a seam keep the `〔承前页〕` marker rather than swallow text" - that is the
  complex tier: parse -> slice by book structure -> `overlap_check` -> per-chapter translation -> `dedup_boundary` ->
  `qa_check` -> merge. Time is not measured here, so estimate by segment and batch count; degradations are in the tiers above.
- **Positive (80-page archive, one master)**: "Translate these 80 pages of English archive into Chinese, keep the page
  marks, leave quotations in the notes untouched" - the 100-300 page row allows leaner batches; page marks and broken
  sentences are preserved per the hard rules.
- **Counter-example (adjacent need, not this skill)**: "just translate this one-page meeting summary tonight" - the
  routing table says under 10 pages do not use this package; "turn this translation into a typeset parallel edition" -
  out of scope (single-language master plus reading HTML only); "judge whether this passage of source material is
  authentic" - that is verification/research work, a different skill.
