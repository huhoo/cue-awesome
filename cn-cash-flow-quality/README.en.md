# Cash-Flow Quality · Every Figure Sourced

Give a financial report and get the third statement read into a register where **every number goes back to a quoted sentence**: operating, investing and financing cash flows, plus the net-cash ratio, the collection ratio, free cash flow and the indirect-method reconciliation.

The income statement says how much was earned. This skill says whether **the money was actually collected**.

**No fraud calls, no distress warnings, no forecasts of next period, no ratings, no target prices.** Ratios come from disclosed text only; anything self-computed is flagged and must name where both the numerator and the denominator came from.

---

## 1. Start here: three steps

1. **Fix the subject and the reporting period**, and get the original report — three places matter: the cash-flow statement, the consolidated income statement, and the supplementary cash-flow notes.
2. **Copy facts with their sentences**: one figure = one line, ending in `「quote」〔anchor: page/table〕[S#]`.
3. **Run the checker** and fix whatever turns red:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_cash_flow.py your-note.md
python3 scripts/check_cash_flow.py --selftest      # 12 built-in fixtures
```

Exit codes: `0` all clear, `1` findings raised, `3` file unreadable or empty.

### Confirming the channel is present (optional)

Only needed once `CUE_API_KEY` is configured. List the catalog first, then confirm the tools are present at the routing address it gives:

```bash
CATALOG="https://cuecue.cn/api/mcp-catalog"
curl -s "$CATALOG" | head -c 2000
# take the group's routing address from the catalog, then confirm the tools are present
curl -s -X POST "$ROUTING_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

Without a credential the skill still works: put the report in the working directory and use the user-supplied path.

## 2. What the five checks enforce

| Code | Name | What it checks | What it most often catches |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CF-STRUCT` | Form | Four self-labels, `主体：` and `报告期：` present; seven sections present and ordered; each of the first five has at least one finding line | A missing section; a heading with nothing under it |
| `CF-QUOTE` | Quote and anchor | Every figure line ends in quote + anchor + `[S#]`; source lines carry a clickable URL and a retrieval date; every cited number is registered | A figure with no quoted sentence; a source line with no link |
| `CF-NOSELF` | No self-computed ratios | Net-cash, collection and FCF values not stated in the quote must be flagged `〔自算〕` with numerator and denominator sources; the reconciliation table may not be merged or absoluted | Dividing operating cash flow by net profit and presenting it as disclosed; collapsing reconciliation rows into a "total" |
| `CF-GAP` | Gaps named both ways | A gap in the body must appear in section six, and vice versa; zero gaps must be stated explicitly | Brushing a gap aside with "not applicable" |
| `CF-LINE` | Red lines | Fraud, distress, prediction, ratings and "worth watching" — zero tolerance | "Positive operating cash flow means no fraud" |

---

## 3. The four red lines

1. **The net-cash ratio is never presented as a disclosed figure.** Operating cash flow and net profit are two different bases; unless the report states the ratio in the same sentence, flag `〔自算〕`.
2. **The indirect-method table is copied item by item.** No merging, no absolute values — the sign is the information.
3. **Free cash flow has no invented definition.** Either copy a disclosed figure, or flag `〔自算〕` and state which line item capex comes from.
4. **Closing cash is not the balance-sheet cash balance.** Restricted cash and the scope of cash equivalents differ; never treat them as equal.

---

## 4. What one finding looks like

```markdown
- 经营活动产生的现金流量净额 12,340.00 万元「经营活动产生的现金流量净额 123,400,000.00 元」〔锚：2025 年年报·第 58 页·合并现金流量表〕[S1]
```

A self-computed ratio looks like this (numerator and denominator each sourced):

```markdown
- 净现比为 1.21 倍〔自算〕分子＝经营活动产生的现金流量净额 123,400,000.00 元 [S1]｜分母＝归属于母公司所有者的净利润 102,000,000.00 元 [S2]
```

## 5. How this differs from the other packages

| You have | Use |
|---|---|
| The cash-flow statement, net-cash, collection and free cash flow | **this skill** |
| Income-statement commentary: period differences, account reconciliation | `cn-earnings-note` |
| Inventory, receivables, contract assets | `cn-working-capital-quality` |
| Goodwill impairment risk | `cn-goodwill-impairment-risk` |
| Dividends, buybacks, reductions | `cn-shareholder-return` |

## 6. Zero channel: build the skeleton first

It runs without any channel artifact — the script only reads the listing you give it:

```bash
python3 scripts/make_outline.py listing.jsonl skeleton.md
```

Each JSONL line needs `title`, `url` and `asof` (`YYYY-MM-DD`); `id` is optional and defaults to `S1`, `S2`… in line order.

- Bad lines (invalid JSON, missing key, malformed date, non-http url) are **named one by one and not used**; good lines are still taken.
- **An empty listing exits 1** rather than emitting an empty shell.
- The skeleton **fails the checks on purpose** — that is the design, not a defect to fix.

```bash
python3 scripts/make_outline.py --selftest       # 7 built-in fixtures
```

---

## 7. Running the fixtures

```bash
bash scripts/fixtures/run_fixtures.sh
```

Three tiers: checker self-test / good and bad samples run one by one / line-by-line substitution on the good sample as a positive-and-negative control. Zero network, zero billing; artifacts land only in a temp directory and are deleted afterwards.

The last line reports `档数=3｜不合=N｜不可判=N`; exit `0` all pass, `1` a mismatch, `3` a value-domain fault.

---

## 8. Where material comes from

- **User-supplied**: annual reports and announcements you already have, via `+parse`.
- **Channel retrieval**: with `CUE_API_KEY` set, report search and original-text parsing become available. Skill installed ≠ credential configured ≠ channel connected — three separate things.
- **Zero channel**: `make_outline.py` builds the skeleton; see section 6.

This skill issues no requests and pays for nothing; consumption is reported as the server returns it.

## 9. Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` / `SKILL.en.md` | Chinese and English faces with the check contract |
| `scripts/check_cash_flow.py` | The five checks; `--selftest` runs the built-in fixtures |
| `scripts/make_outline.py` | Listing → skeleton; `--selftest` runs the built-in fixtures |
| `scripts/fixtures/` | 1 good + 5 bad + the runner |
