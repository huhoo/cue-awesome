# paper-study-cn

**English companion of `README.md` (Chinese primary; the pair is for reading inside the repository — skill-channel pages do not resolve relative links, so this is deliberately not a clickable switch).**

**Turn the paper at hand into a checkable study card: every claim carries a page or section anchor, reproducibility gaps are named one by one, the citation list only holds what the paper itself cites, and academic judgement stays marked `[待人工]`.**

Not a writing service, not a literature mover. This skill does the other half of the job: making the paper actually readable - every point locatable, every citation traceable. Paper input comes two ways only: the file you provide and a publicly reachable link.

**Input**: a public PDF URL / a local file path / pasted text - one card per paper
**Output**: one filled-in `assets/论文研读卡.md` card - paper card, reproducibility list, citation network, review scaffold, pending list
**Cost**: the first two parts depend only on the file actually read this time; the citation network and scaffold material are fetched on demand
**Machine gate**: `scripts/check_study_card.py`, four lanes (format / anchors / red lines / counts and declarations), zero network

---

## 1. Open it and work: three steps today

These three are the only "do it now" part. The first sentence can be copied verbatim: **"read this paper, give me the paper card and the reproducibility list first"**.

| Step | Action | How | What happens if you skip it |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Hand over the source, copy the edition** | Give the PDF path or link; take title, authors and volume/issue **from inside the paper**, and write `缺` (absent) when the text does not say | Nobody can tell which version was read, and every later anchor may belong to a different preprint or final edition |
| 2 | **Anchor every row of the paper card** | Add a page or section locator to claim, method, data and conclusion (P3, page 8, section 4, references); delete any row whose locator you cannot supply | Points cannot be traced back to sentences, citation checking turns into impression, and that is exactly how invention enters |
| 3 | **Run the gate before quoting** | `python3 scripts/check_study_card.py my-card.md`, then fix each detail line by its `E-*` code | Hedged figures, unanchored citations and unconfirmed inferred slots travel into your manuscript, and no one can check them for you |

The citation network and the review scaffold come **after** these three: the first is bounded by this package's search surface (section 7), the second needs your own thesis slots.

## 2. The five parts and the four lanes

| Part | Content | What the gate enforces |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Paper card | Title, authors, year, core claim, method, data, conclusion - one anchor per row; absent fields written as `缺` with `不适用` - and a pasted text with no page or section to point at follows the gate wording verbatim: content `缺`, anchor `不适用`, an empty slot `空槽（不硬填）`; never invent line or paragraph anchors (the gate accepts only P×／×页／第×节／参考文献区) in the anchor cell | Content without anchor -> `E-ANCHOR`; an anchor number beyond the page set on the card （e.g. `P99` when the set says 共 13 页） -> `E-ANCHOR`; hedged numbers -> `E-BANWORD` |
| 2 Reproducibility list | Dataset availability, whether a code link exists, parameter completeness - **gaps only, never a verdict on reproducibility** | Fewer than three accounted items -> `E-COVERAGE`; "`应该能复现`" style claims -> `E-BANWORD` |  **The reverse also holds**: renaming an item in the template changes this gate ruler in the same move (the ruler has a single source, no second copy). A rename is a contract change, so old cards and fixtures must be renamed in the same batch; if they are not, `--selftest` fails loudly (the good sample turns red) rather than passing silently - that red means template and cards have drifted apart, so reconcile them instead of loosening the gate.
| 3 Citation network | Entries taken only from the paper's own reference list, each with a locator; citation counts declared when not retrieved | Entry without locator -> `E-ANCHOR`; neither entries nor a ticked declaration -> `E-COVERAGE` |
| 4 Review scaffold | Thesis slots belong to the user: given by them, or inferred and then explicitly confirmed; material sentences must be anchored, otherwise leave `空槽（不硬填）` | Unanchored material -> `E-ANCHOR`; unconfirmed inferred slot or unticked origin -> `E-COVERAGE` |
| 5 Pending list | Everything that needs the original text, with academic judgement under `[待人工]` | Missing the `[待人工]` roll-up -> `E-COVERAGE` |

The header has its own hard set: **the three self-labels** (`AI 研读整理`, `观点请回原文核对`, `不构成学术评价`) **plus** the file this read is based on, the paper edition (or `缺`), and the **channel page set** - whatever the parse echoed, written as `共 N 页`; when it is not available write `未取` and declare `页集比对跳过` on the same line. Any of them missing or still a placeholder is an `E-FORMAT`. When the page set is recorded, the gate compares every page anchor against it - **an anchor beyond the set fires `E-ANCHOR`**; a missing set without that declaration fires `E-COVERAGE`.

## 3. Getting started

```bash
# 1. Put it in the skills directory
mkdir -p ~/.workbuddy/skills
cp -r paper-study-cn ~/.workbuddy/skills/

# 2. Copy the card template and fill it following section 1
cp ~/.workbuddy/skills/paper-study-cn/assets/论文研读卡.md ./my-card.md

# 3. Run the gate (no network)
python3 ~/.workbuddy/skills/paper-study-cn/scripts/check_study_card.py ./my-card.md
```

Read `assets/论文研读卡.md` first (that is the five-part shape), then `SKILL.md` §3 for the contract itself.

### Self-check

```bash
python3 scripts/check_study_card.py --help                            # usage; no network
python3 scripts/check_study_card.py --selftest                        # good sample must pass, bad sample must fire all four lanes, both single-point counter-examples must fire and name the missing class, and the isolation tier must fail loudly (unreadable ruler source)
python3 scripts/check_study_card.py scripts/fixtures/good-study-card.md   # should PASS
python3 scripts/check_study_card.py scripts/fixtures/bad-study-card.md    # should FAIL, all four codes
python3 scripts/check_study_card.py scripts/fixtures/mut-repro-one-class.md                               # should FAIL: three reproduction rows are present but two class names were collapsed into one; the finding names the missing classes
python3 scripts/check_study_card.py scripts/fixtures/mut-class-in-evidence.md                             # should FAIL: the class name appears only in the evidence cell; the item cell lacks it
python3 scripts/check_study_card.py assets/论文研读卡.md                   # should FAIL - a blank card failing the gate is the design, not a defect
```

**Take every count from the script's own report line** (`FAIL: … (N items)` and the `扫过 N 行，发条 0 条` line under `PASS:`); this file does not restate them - a restated count becomes a second source of truth and drifts on every script change. **Two line-count conventions**: `扫过 N 行` counts `split('\n')` elements, which is `wc -l` **+1** (the trailing newline occupies one); when reporting a line count, report the convention with it so nobody reads the gap as a counting error.

### First-time Cue setup (three steps, skippable)

This package has one evidence leg: parsing of papers and long documents (omni), which yields text with an outline, locatable sections and page anchors.
**Not installing raises no error** - without it the study card is still hand-fillable and still passes the gate; with the channel off, page anchors and section locations stop working and only whole-paragraph quotation from the text in hand remains - this package does not guess the channel's format. The enhancement leg (academic database search) is not offered here and no sentence claiming paper-retrieval reach is written.

1. Register at <https://cuecue.cn> (new accounts get 500 credits at signup and 10 credits daily - the server-side policy governs);
2. Get `CUE_API_KEY` at <https://cuecue.cn/hub/api-key> and store it in your local credential facility - **never paste it into chat**; the agent never handles the key;
3. Install the one skill(s) this package's evidence legs use: `cue-omni-reader` - the study card's page anchors and section locations come from its response. All of them ship in Cue's official skill collection (sensedeal); one command, two forms:
   - whole set: `npx skills add sensedeal/cue-skills` (it lists the skills published in that collection; pick what to install);
   - one at a time: `npx skills add sensedeal/cue-skills --skill cue-omni-reader`.

   Afterwards check three separate things, because they are not the same fact: **skill installed ≠ credentials configured ≠ channel connected**.
   - installed: list your installed skills again and the names from the command above show up (this only proves the files landed, not that data flows);
   - credentials configured: the `CUE_API_KEY` from step 2 exists in your local credential facility - never paste its value into chat and do not echo it in a terminal;
   - connected: connect to the target domain with that key following the `url` inside its own `routing` (`Authorization: Bearer <$CUE_API_KEY>`, plus `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` - missing that header gives a 406, protocol behaviour, not an authentication failure; the key from the layer above merely being present says nothing about whether it is accepted - that becomes judgeable only here) **and** `tools/list` returns. How to ask: send a JSON-RPC `tools/list` request to the address that domain's `routing` gives you. What counts as passing: HTTP 200 and a non-empty `result.tools` in the body (verbatim shape `{"result":{"tools":[...]}}`, tool names and input schemas inside it) - **the tool list follows that response's current values; this package promises no specific set of tools and hardcodes no tool names**. An anonymous `GET` of the `CATALOG` defined in the block returning on the spot proves only that the **catalog is reachable** - this package does not call that "connected": it yields each domain's `external_status` and the live domains' `routing`, and a domain missing from it stays uninstalled and unpromised here. A connection error is not "the domain has no data": report it as-is and retry only what the error marks as retryable.

   ```bash
   CATALOG="https://cuecue.cn/api/mcp-catalog"
   curl -s "$CATALOG" | python3 -c 'import json,sys
   rows=json.load(sys.stdin)["data"]["domains"]
   [print(r.get("id"), r.get("external_status"), (r.get("routing") or {}).get("url", "-")) for r in rows]'
   DOMAIN_ID="<replace with one of the ids listed by the line above>"
   ROUTING_URL="$(curl -s "$CATALOG" | python3 -c 'import json,sys
   rows=json.load(sys.stdin)["data"]["domains"]
   hit=[r["routing"]["url"] for r in rows if r.get("id")==sys.argv[1] and r.get("routing")]
   print(*hit,sep="\n") if hit else sys.exit("Not found: that id is not in the catalog response (or its routing has no url field) - run the line above and pick one of the ids listed")' "$DOMAIN_ID")"
   [ -n "$ROUTING_URL" ] || { echo "Fetch failed: ROUTING_URL is empty - run the line above, then set DOMAIN_ID to one of the ids listed" >&2; exit 1; }
   curl -s -X POST "$ROUTING_URL" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $CUE_API_KEY" \
     -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' \
     -w '\nHTTP %{http_code}\n'
   ```

   The routing placeholder in this block is filled by the two lines above, fetched live from the anonymous catalog response - the verbatim url field inside that domain's routing object; CATALOG in the block is the only catalog-entry literal on this face (assigned once, not restated in prose). This face hardcodes no domain or path; the credential variable comes from the local key established in the layer above (never into chat, never echoed in a terminal), and this block adds no new credential-reading step. The pass verdict stays exactly as written there; this block does not set up a second one.
   One precision note about the live reply: this endpoint may answer in SSE form (an event line followed by a data line), and the result.tools to look for lives inside that data payload - the verdict is unchanged, the body is just wrapped one layer deeper.
   One-command form (no need to edit the line inside the block): `cd paper-study-cn && python3 -B scripts/cue_connectivity_check.py --domain <your domain id> --post`. This shipped script sends nothing by default - without --post it only fetches the url inside that domain routing and shows it to you. To see which ids exist, run the same script with `--list` first (it lists domains and urls, no POST). This script sets up no second criterion, 4 means connectivity is not proven yet (rerun with --post), 5 means it connected but the live values did not satisfy it, 1 means nothing could be fetched, nothing could be sent, or the HTTP layer itself reported an error (4xx and 5xx included), 6 means the destination failed the two credential-egress gates - nothing was sent and not one credential byte was attached, 7 means the catalog entry itself was not https. On the default catalog entry this script only checks runtime-endpoint connectivity - it publishes nothing to any channel and creates no acceptance record. **A swapped source is not exempt from the check**: whether that url came from the default catalog, from --catalog-url or from the --catalog-file snapshot, the request carrying the key must first pass the same two gates - the scheme must be https, and the host must match an authorized suffix (the default one is derived from the catalog entry in this script header, not a list invented here; pass --allow-host to authorize another). If it does not pass, the script refuses and prints the reason together with that host, and it neither reads the key nor builds the request. The cost is stated in the same breath: the old "whatever the swapped source hands over gets dialled" behaviour is closed off, and what you get in exchange is credentials that never leave toward an unauthorised destination - if your legitimate endpoint sits outside the suffix, exit 6 is the script asking you to confirm it with --allow-host, not a claim that endpoint should not exist.

Parsing spend is **asked before it burns**: before launching, the agent says how many files and which kinds and waits for your consent; billing and availability follow the server response, and this package restates no domain list, writes no tool count; What gets reported first is the time scale and whether a spend occurs, not a price - no price is given and promises no citation counts.

Install this package itself: npx skills add huhoo/cue-awesome --skill paper-study-cn (this installs only this package; afterwards list your installed skills again and seeing paper-study-cn there is what proves the files landed). Dropping this directory into your host's skills folder (e.g. ~/.claude/skills/paper-study-cn) works the same way.

## 4. Boundaries and non-promises

- This produces **study working drafts**: not ghostwriting, not paraphrase-for-lowering-similarity, not polished submission text, and not a substitute for your judgement. Such requests are declined and pointed back to this section.
- **Paper content may only come from the file actually read this time.** Nothing is supplied from memory; quotations and figures stay verbatim - no rewriting, no rounding, no hedging.
- Inventing citations, page numbers or conclusions is this package's worst failure mode - the `E-ANCHOR` lane exists to stop it: **delete a row whose locator you cannot produce instead of guessing one.**
- **Anchor validity is carried by an external verbatim re-checker; the gate is a shape gate, not a fact gate.** It catches "content without a locator" and "anchor beyond the page set on the card"; it cannot tell whether a sentence really sits on page N. That layer belongs to a checker that compares each quoted fragment **byte for byte** against the text the parser returned, and its result travels with the deliverable (part 3 of each case in this package's P1 account shows that shape). The page set itself comes from the parse echo, never from memory.
- **Academic search is outside this package**: no bibliographic-database retrieval, no citation-count promise; paper input is the file you hand over plus publicly reachable links. Grant and project sources (the domain list follows the live catalog) may serve as **auxiliary background**, quoted only from this run's output - one hit does not mean a hit every time.
- Input format, size and whether something parses follow **the actual channel response**; when an input does not fit, the skill stops and says why, rather than pretending it read the document.
- **One explicit confirmation for inferred thesis slots**: a slot this skill guesses stays marked "inferred, awaiting user confirmation" until you answer clearly, and only then becomes "confirmed: <date>"; bare replies like "ok", "mm" or "sure" are not confirmation. Before that, completed-form wording ("I've built your review for you") stays out of the text.
- Academic judgement - novelty, reliability, whether a paper deserves citation - stays `[待人工]`. No reviewer reports are produced.

## 5. When something goes wrong (symptom -> cause -> recovery)

**Whatever is absent from this run's tool output is written as "not found"**: a parameter, field or enum value that does not appear there must not be filled from memory - write `未检索到` (not found) and log it on the pending or coverage list; a blank never stands in for it.

**Error-level findings are blockers**: never describe them as harmless, ignorable, or shippable-as-is - fix them, or declare them explicitly on the deliverable.

The output shape is taken from a live run of `check_study_card.py` as it now stands: a failure prints one line `FAIL: <file> (N items)`, then each detail line **starts with an error code (one of four `E-*`)** such as `[E-FORMAT]`, `[E-ANCHOR]` (its `页集` lane marks an anchor beyond the page set), `[E-BANWORD]`, followed by the lane name, the line number and that lane's spec; the last line `码表:` lists only the codes actually used and what they mean. A pass prints `PASS: <file> (...)` plus two counts - lines scanned, findings raised - **read off that line, with the `split('\n')` convention (one more than `wc -l`) named alongside**.

This package uses **four** codes, byte-identical to the sibling packages' table (those packages are repo-side and do not ship with this published artifact; compare inside the repository). The fifth, `E-LEDGER`, belongs to ledger state machines; this skill has no ledger, so it is deliberately not enabled - that is not an omission. The full set and the classification rules live in the script, not in this file; run this line from any directory to locate them:

    grep -n "^E_LEGEND" ~/.workbuddy/skills/paper-study-cn/scripts/check_study_card.py

| Symptom (detail prefix) | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `[E-FORMAT]` header or source lanes | One of the three self-labels missing; or the source file, the paper edition or the channel page set is still a placeholder or absent | Complete the header; take the edition from inside the paper and the page set from the parse echo; write `缺` / `未取` when the run did not give them - neither cell is ever guessed |
| `[E-FORMAT]` section lanes | A part is missing or out of order | Restore the order from section 2; keep the template's section names verbatim, because renaming them hides the section from the gate |
| `[E-ANCHOR]` paper-card, citation or slot lanes | Content without a locator; a cited work whose position in the paper cannot be given; slot material without an anchor | Add a proper locator (P3 / page 8 / section 4 / references); **if you cannot, delete the row - an invented citation is the worst failure this package has** |
| `[E-ANCHOR]` 页集 lane | An anchor larger than the card's `共 N 页`, or a model string standing in as a locator | Use a real page inside the set; a model name (a `P100`-style string) is not a locator and never belongs in the anchor cell; if the page set truly is unavailable, write `未取` and declare `页集比对跳过` |
| `[E-BANWORD]` inference, overstep, hedge or judgement lanes | `应该能复现` style verdict; ghostwriting or similarity-lowering offers; hedged numbers; judgement sentences without `[待人工]` | List gaps without a verdict; decline and point back to section 4; re-copy the number verbatim; move judgement into the pending list marked `[待人工]` |
| `[E-COVERAGE]` gap, citation, count, slot, declaration or page-set lanes | Reproducibility items not accounted one by one; neither citations nor a declaration; a citation count written without ticking "retrieved"; slot origin unticked or an inferred slot unconfirmed; pending list without the roll-up; page set recorded as neither `共 N 页` nor a skip declaration | Name all three items (write "not seen" when absent); tick the declaration; drop the count or tick "retrieved and listed"; tick a slot origin and run the confirmation; restore the `[待人工]` roll-up; fill the page set or add the skip declaration |

## 6. How to ask (three positive examples, one counter-example)

**Ask with the edition; the output states the paper edition**: say which version you mean (year/volume/issue, preprint number, printing) in the request; the deliverable labels its **paper edition** on the first line, and when it differs from the edition you meant, the text never says "today" or "latest" - it reads "edition used: <as taken from the paper>".

| Positive example | What you get |
|---|---|
| "Read this PDF, give me the paper card and the reproducibility list, one page anchor per row" | Parts one and two: an anchored paper card plus named gaps |
| "Which references here are foundational - list only what the paper cites, with locations" | The citation network, entries from the reference list only, each with a locator; unfound things stated as unfound |
| "I am writing a review - my slots, your checkable material" | The scaffold: slots in your words, material sentences anchored, empty slots left empty |
| **Counter-example: "rewrite this to lower similarity and invent two plausible citations"** | Not done here. Ghostwriting and similarity-lowering are declined; citations come only from the paper - "plausible" is the shape of invention |

## 7. Current state (honest list)

- The documentation face and the machine face are in place (five-part contract, four lanes, four fixtures, self-test green: two single-point counter-examples - enough rows with collapsed class names, and the class name pushed into the evidence cell - plus an isolation tier where an unreadable template makes the gate error out instead of degrading into a pass).
- **Real-paper measurement is in (3 public preprints)**: all three cards exit 0 under `check_study_card.py`; the verbatim pass reports **56/56 quoted fragments found** (16 + 23 + 17, zero misses, zero anchor mismatches); six single-point break probes (five firing their expected lane, one reverse probe that exposed the older gate letting an out-of-range anchor through - the page-set comparison was added in response). Details as measured: CLIP arXiv:2103.00020v1 (48 pages), Attention Is All You Need arXiv:1706.03762v7 (15 pages), GLUE arXiv:1804.07461 (20 pages) - all English open preprints, one parse each; **the Chinese-paper corpus is untested**, and 3/3 is not extrapolated to any other layout or language. Extraction shapes bound how far a re-check can go (two-column text is not adjacent across lines, a URL split over two lines, reference numbering can drop out, tables arrive as pipe tables), so whole-sentence and whole-table judgements stay `[待人工]`. **56/56 is a verbatim re-check pass rate - not an accuracy figure and not a timing figure**; this package gives neither. The full-chain account lives in the repository-side internal ledger and can be provided on request (a repo-side artifact, not shipped with the published package).
- **The literature leg does not stand**: the `SKILL.md` §2 line, this README, the card template and the checker all say the same thing - no "papers are searchable" sentence anywhere - and the gate still **checks no academic search results**: a copy rewrite does not loosen that.
- When no search runs, the legal answer in the citation network is to tick "not found" / "surface not covered, pending"; the gate accepts that declaration.
- Channel shapes (page anchors, section locators, accepted formats and sizes) follow the actual response; this package neither restates that list nor counts tools.

## 8. Dependencies

- `python3` (only `scripts/check_study_card.py`; standard library, zero network, sends no request)
- The parsing channel is an **optional auxiliary**: the card can be filled by hand and still pass the gate; with the channel, anchors and section locators come from its response, whose shape this package does not guess.

## 9. Contents

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` | Main instructions and the five-part contract (design authority, Chinese primary) |
| `assets/论文研读卡.md` | The card template you fill |
| `scripts/check_study_card.py` | Four-lane gate (format / anchors / red lines / counts and declarations) |
| `scripts/fixtures/good-study-card.md` | Green sample (fictional content, not a real-literature citation) |
| `scripts/fixtures/bad-study-card.md` | Red sample (one counter-example per lane) |
| `scripts/fixtures/mut-repro-one-class.md` | Single-point counter-example fixture (exactly one thing broken; runs in the counter-example tier of `--selftest`) |
| `scripts/fixtures/mut-class-in-evidence.md` | Single-point counter-example fixture (exactly one thing broken): the class name is moved into the evidence cell to fake coverage - the gate reads the item cell only, so this sample must fire |
| `README.md` | Chinese primary of this file |

Version history lives in `CHANGELOG.md`.
