# dd-checklist

**English companion of `README.md` (Chinese primary; the pair is for reading inside the repository — skill-channel pages do not resolve relative links, so this is deliberately not a clickable switch).**

**How far does the public record actually get you?** This checklist answers in two parts: every risk item it can support is laid out with an anchor you can trace back to a live disclosure, and everything it cannot find is recorded by category, with the reason — **no tool in the domain** versus **zero hits inside the window**. It hands you no conclusion; the verdict slots stay `[待人工]` (human-only).

Give it a single subject, an `asof` date, a lookback window and a purpose tier, and you get a fixed seven-column risk table plus a nine-category coverage ledger and a full evidence snapshot directory. The enemy here is not a missed query — it is **an invented risk item that looks plausible**, so the first gate is hard-coded: a live anchor, a live date inside the window, and unambiguous attribution. Miss any one and the row does not enter the table; it enters the ledger.

**Inputs**: `--subject` (exactly one) · `--asof` · `--lookback` (e.g. `36m`, mandatory) · `--purpose` (investment/credit/mna) · `--sources` · `--evidence` — all six are mandatory
**Outputs**: `dd-<code>-<asof>/` — `report.md` · `sources.jsonl` · `evidence/` (with `LEDGER.sha256`) · `references/coverage-map.md` · `progress.md`
**Cost**: five pipeline stages plus one eight-layer gate; deep research is launched only where a gap demands it, with time and consumption reported before it starts — billing is whatever the server returns

---

## 1. What it is / what it is not

| You want | Use |
|---|---|
| Public-record risk items for one subject over one window, each one anchored | **this skill** |
| A pre-meeting glance across several subjects | sibling `tear-sheet` |
| Confirmed dates in a forward window | sibling `catalyst-calendar` |
| Deep earnings review and promise-versus-delivery reconciliation | sibling `cn-earnings-note` |
| An investment verdict, a legal qualification, or a claim that the record is fully covered | not offered — the verdict slots stay empty, and all three phrasings are machine-checked violations |

## 2. Four things that are nailed down

- **Only the last column counts as an anchor.** An announcement number dropped into the fact column does not substitute, and a digit string that merely resembles an event id — an amount, a share count — is not an anchor. An empty row is acceptable; an anchored hallucination is not.
- **"Not found" comes in three kinds.** No tool in the domain (out of reach, needs human or commercial databases); zero hits (queried, nothing disclosed in the window); not attempted (this run did not query it). Turning the first kind into "the company has no litigation" is the red line of this package.
- **Evidence is fail-closed.** A missing or empty `evidence/`, or a hash mismatch, stops delivery — no "ship now, attach proof later". Every anchor in the table must be findable verbatim in a snapshot, and a legally-derived date must find the statutory text itself.
- **No free arithmetic on dates.** A derivation such as "due within N days after the reporting period" only earns a row if the statute was fetched on the spot, with law name, article number and a short quote all present in the evidence. The `statute` domain does not carry ministry-level rules or exchange rules, so this path currently **expects zero anchors**; if nothing comes back, the row is refused and the reason is written to the ledger.

## 3. Quick start (three steps)

1. **Install**: drop this directory into your agent's skills directory.
2. **Ask**: "run a public-record pre-diligence checklist on Beichen, last three years". A missing window or purpose tier gets a question back — it will not guess for you.
3. **Receive**: five stages, then the gate:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/check_dd.py report.md \
     --subject '北辰股份有限公司（600001.SH）' --asof 2026-09-21 --lookback 36m --purpose investment \
     --sources sources.jsonl --evidence evidence
   ```

   The diagnostic codes come in layers (`DD-INPUT` / `DD-TABLE` / `DD-ROW` / `DD-REDLINE` / `DD-COVERAGE` / `DD-EVIDENCE` / `DD-STATUTE` / `DD-OMISSION` listed here as a mirror of the set; the set itself is the script as it now stands — locate it with the command in §5). No pass, no delivery. Fixture bank: `bash scripts/fixtures/run_fixtures.sh`.

## 4. First-time Cue setup (three steps, skippable)

Register at <https://cuecue.cn> (new accounts get 500 on signup and 10 daily, per server policy) → take `CUE_API_KEY` from <https://cuecue.cn/hub/api-key> into local credential storage (**never paste it into chat**) → install `cue-data-mcp` (`cue-omni-reader` as needed).
It also runs without the channels: paste the disclosures yourself and the agent organizes them, tagged user-supplied (L2) — but the coverage ledger will say plainly that no domain query happened, and the value of this deliverable lives precisely in that ledger.

## 5. What is in the package

```
SKILL.md                            main instruction: input contract / first gate / seven-column form / pipeline and gate / human review list (read this)
README.md / README.en.md            this file (Chinese is authoritative) and its English translation
CHANGELOG.md                        version history
references/channel-map.md           nine categories × domain intent, known capability edges, degradation paths
references/coverage-map-template.md ledger template and the three kinds of "not found"
scripts/check_dd.py                 the gate itself (diagnostic-code layering, stdlib only; the code set and every word list are the script as it now stands)
                                 note: every claim below about which words get blocked, which shapes count as anchors and which categories are legal points back to the script as it now stands — one command locates them, runnable from any directory (it carries the installed path):
                                     grep -n "^CATEGORIES = \|^KINDS = \|^HEADER_COLS = \|^IMPACTS = \|^PURPOSES = \|^CONFIDENCES = \|^REDLINE_INVEST = \|^REDLINE_LEGAL = \|^REDLINE_COMPLETE = \|^CONFESSION = \|^NO_TOOL_ASSERT = \|^AGE_LAUNDER = \|^FACT_MAX = " ~/.workbuddy/skills/dd-checklist/scripts/check_dd.py
                                     bash ~/.workbuddy/skills/dd-checklist/scripts/fixtures/run_fixtures.sh (fixture and guard inventory, run live)
                                     Installed elsewhere: replace ~/.workbuddy/skills/ with your own skills directory; on Windows: C:\Users\<username>\.workbuddy\skills\dd-checklist\scripts\check_dd.py
                                     Both lines rely on POSIX tooling (grep / bash) — on Windows run them in Git Bash or WSL. The first prints the line number of each definition: single-line ones are visible at once, multi-line tuples read down to the closing parenthesis;
                                     the word and category examples here and in CONTRACT.md are common examples, not an exhaustive claim — where a mirror and the code disagree, the code governs.
scripts/gen_fixtures.py             idempotent re-generator for the whole bank (for re-spawning after new questions; never the other way round)
scripts/fixtures/                   question bank: one sample per contract question, plus positive-path guard samples; the runner grades by exact diagnostic-code set
```

## 6. FAQ and anti-patterns (what you try to do -> this skill refuses, because -> where to go instead)

Reviewed clauses re-assembled, no new promise. The category set, anchor kinds and forbidden phrasings are whatever
`check_dd.py` holds now (locator command in section 5).

| What you try | Does it work, and why not | Where to go instead |
|---|---|---|
| End with a verdict: invest or pass | **No.** The judgement slot stays `[待人工]`; this package ships anchored facts plus a ledger of what could not be checked | A person decides; for a pre-meeting page use `tear-sheet` |
| Write "the company has no such issue" for categories you could not check | **No.** Not found is not absence; entity-negative assertions are forbidden for no-tool items | Record it in the coverage ledger, stating whether the domain had no tool or the search returned zero |
| Derive the statutory filing deadline in passing | **Refused unless the statute text is on record.** Derivation needs the rule text and decidable applicability conditions together | No row plus one line of reasoning and the probe list in `progress.md` (this path is expected to yield zero anchors today) |
| Screen several issuers at once | **No** (one subject per run); batching is how per-entry anchors degrade | One subject per run; batch one-pagers go to `tear-sheet` |
| Skip the lookback window and let you default it | **No.** The window is mandatory; no wall-clock default | Give an explicit span (last three years, or 12 months back from a stated as-of date) |
| Want the rating paragraph, the price paragraph and the legal-qualification paragraph | **Only restated from the disclosure, with anchors**; no opinion, no finding of compliance | Qualification belongs to a person; this guarantees every line resolves to source text |

## 7. When something goes wrong (symptom -> cause -> recovery)

**Whatever is absent from this run's tool output is written as "not found"**: a parameter, field or enum value that does not appear there must not be filled from memory - write "not found" and log it on the pending or coverage list; a blank never stands in for it.

**Error-level findings are blockers**: never describe them as harmless, ignorable, or shippable-as-is - fix them, or declare them explicitly on the deliverable.

Shapes are taken from **the current output** of `check_dd.py`, captured by running it: detail lines come first, each **starting with an error-code prefix (one of the five `E-*` codes), then this package's `DD-*` diagnostic code**, followed by the line number and a Chinese cause; the last two lines are `code legend:` (only the codes used) and `RESULT: FAIL report.md (N items; code set DD-*...)`. A clean pass prints `RESULT: PASS report.md (all eight gates passed)`.

The five `E-*` codes are a closed suite-wide identical set (byte-identical with the four siblings); the eight `DD-*` codes are this package's layered diagnostics - **both are printed together**: `E-*` names the handling family, `DD-*` names which gate fired. Both tables live in the script, printable from anywhere by swapping these two keys into the grep in section 5:

    grep -n "^E_LEGEND\|^E_RULES" ~/.workbuddy/skills/dd-checklist/scripts/check_dd.py

| Symptom (detail prefix) | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `[E-FORMAT] DD-INPUT: ...` | One of the six mandatory parameters missing or illegal (subject shape, date shape, purpose outside the closed enum) | Supply all six; the subject accepts both "Full name (6-digit code.SH\|.SZ\|.BJ)" and a bare code |
| `[E-FORMAT] DD-ROW: line N ...` / `[E-FORMAT] DD-TABLE: ...` | Seven-column shape broken, category or impact value outside the enum, dates not ascending, anchor not in the last column, or a hedging word in the facts cell | Fix per the bracketed spec; delete a row containing a confession word rather than rephrasing the same claim |
| `[E-ANCHOR] DD-EVIDENCE: ...` | Table row without a ledger entry, or ledger entry without a raw snapshot; missing `evidence/` or hash mismatch | Add the `sources.jsonl` line and drop the raw response into `evidence/` (verifiable via `LEDGER.sha256`); a missing directory is fail-closed - deliver first, evidence later is refused |
| `[E-ANCHOR] DD-STATUTE: ...` | Statutory derivation without the rule text on record, or undecidable applicability | Refuse the derivation, emit no row, and log one line of reasoning plus the probe list in `progress.md` (this path is expected to yield zero anchors today) |
| `[E-COVERAGE] DD-COVERAGE: ...` | Nine categories incomplete, a category's count disagrees with the call log, or a long window used the disclosure domain without the required age-declaration line | Complete the ledger category by category; for long windows write the contract's declaration line (collect-then-validate), window start equal to the recomputed window |
| `[E-COVERAGE] DD-OMISSION: ...` | The body claims more domains than the ledger booked | Back-filling requires all three artifacts (all domains in the cell, that domain in the call log, one category-tagged raw file per domain). Deleting the claim without booking the ledger is the failure shape this gate exists for |
| `[E-BANWORD] DD-REDLINE: ...` | An investment verdict, legal qualification or completeness assertion entered the delivery face | Follow the printed legend: rewrite neutrally or delete; the judgement slot returns to `[待人工]` |
| Channel missing / that category has no public tool | No tool for it on the public face | Degradation: the user pastes the disclosure list (marked L2 user-supplied, `sources` uses `user_supplied` + `path`); without the research run the whole category reads "not found" and is booked - never filled by common sense. The price is coverage, not accuracy |
| A traceback instead of `RESULT: FAIL ...` | An incident: parse points are wrapped | Stop and report with the exact command in `progress.md`; run section 5's live commands first to tell a bad report from a broken script |

## 8. How to ask (three positive examples, one counter-example, plus how to pick the purpose tier)

**Ask with a point in time; the output states its data date**: give the reporting period, reference date or look-back window in the request; the deliverable labels its **data date** on the first line, and when that differs from the date you asked about, the text never says "today" or "latest" - it reads "as of <date>".
- **Positive (simplest)**: "Run a public-information pre-diligence ledger for Beichen Corp over the last three
  years" - a missing window or purpose triggers a question instead of a default.
- **Positive (explicit tier + focus, complex input)**: "Subject: Beijing Oriental Yuhong Waterproof Technology
  Co., Ltd. (002271.SZ), as-of 2026-09-23, lookback 12 months, purpose = M&A; focus on control rights, horizontal
  competition and past acquisitions; output to `~/dd/2026q3/`". Tier guidance (the three tiers differ in what must be
  checked): investment = the standard nine categories; credit tightens guarantees and fund occupation; M&A tightens
  control, horizontal competition and acquisition history. Choosing the wrong tier is not cosmetic - it skips checks.
- **Positive (what a follow-up question looks like)**: asking only "diligence Kweichow Moutai for me" should come back
  with three questions: as-of date, lookback window, purpose tier (all six parameters are mandatory). Answer them in
  one line - "as-of today, 24 months back, investment tier" - and work starts.
- **Counter-example (adjacent need, not this skill)**: "also tell me whether to buy it and what it is worth" - no
  verdict, no price; "I only need the confirmed dates in the next three months" - `catalyst-calendar`;
  "a one-pager for a client meeting" - `tear-sheet`.

## 9. Current state (honest list)

- **Built**: contract = this package's `CONTRACT.md` (its revision clauses are numbered in section 0A and resolve inside that file). **The package ships the finished samples and the runner: reproducibility is anchored on `scripts/fixtures/run_fixtures.sh`, which also reports the sample count — no sample-count snapshot lives in these documents.** The question list and the per-question mapping table live in the independent reviewer's workspace and are not part of this package, and no local paths appear here. To re-spawn after new questions: `python3 scripts/gen_fixtures.py --badspec <question-list path>` (no default; samples follow the list, never the other way round, and the script has no grading power).
- **Capability edge (stated plainly)**: `evidence/calls.jsonl` lets the gate machine-catch "the ledger reports fewer than the flow" and "the snapshot the flow points at was deleted or altered", but **a wholesale forged low-hit snapshot is self-consistent with its own flow** — that belongs to the forged-evidence family, which the machine does not disprove; the only defense is the human 3-snapshot verbatim spot check. This package makes no absolute-assurance sentence of that shape (the ban deliberately does not quote the phrasing, so our own literal scans stay clean); what it does commit to is: mismatch blocks delivery, zeroing requires a per-item reason, and under-reporting leaves a machine-side counter-proof.
- **The first real run is on record (2026-09-22)**: **A real single-subject end-to-end run has landed** — 北京东方雨虹防水技术股份有限公司（002271.SZ）with `--asof 2026-09-22 --lookback 12m --purpose investment` (window 2025-09-22~2026-09-22); `check_dd.py` with all six parameters **passed all eight gates at the time and printed the PASS line** (that run did deliver). **Present-tense correction**: re-scanned with the current gate after the §v2-16② domain-set edge landed, this artifact now **exits 1 with two `DD-OMISSION` findings** — for 合规与处罚 and 财务与披露质量 the ledger books one of the two domains the flow actually called. Booked as a known defect tracked internally; the historical artifact is unchanged word for word, and **the PASS credential under the current gate is now on disk** — it is the same-issuer `mna` run described in the next bullet: six parameters, exit 0, PASS line printed. This package still claims no historical artifact passes under the current gate. As measured: **12 anchor-bound rows inside the window** across four categories (equity/control 7, financial & disclosure quality 2, other disclosed material matters 2, related-party & fund occupation 1). **Running through and finding something are two different claims** — all nine categories are booked: three came back with zero hits and two have no public tool (labour & social insurance; listing/review status). `合规与处罚` is booked as zero hits while a coverage difference between the disclosure search face and the full list remains **open and tracked internally**, so the wording is "zero hits, coverage gap under check", never "no penalties". Statutory-deadline derivation was **refused once on the spot** (no such rule text in the statute domain — a known precondition; the reason line sits in the ledger), and one out-of-window downgrade also has its reason line there. Evidence: **20 raw snapshots + a 15-line call flow (chained `seq`/`prev_sha256`) + the LEDGER**. Consumption as reported: **21 data-MCP calls, zero billing; research 0; omni 0**.
- **Current-gate credential (same issuer, `mna` tier, run 2026-09-23)**: 北京东方雨虹防水技术股份有限公司（002271.SZ） with `--asof 2026-09-23 --lookback 12m --purpose mna` (window 2025-09-23~2026-09-23); the current gate `check_dd.py` with all six parameters **exits 0 and prints the eight-gate pass line**. Every number below is read off that artifact: **14 anchor-bound rows** inside the window across four categories (equity/control 6, related-party & fund occupation 4, financial & disclosure quality 2, other disclosed material matters 2), row dates 2025-10-15~2026-08-20; the nine-category ledger holds 9 rows = 4 booked with a 检到 N result (6/4/2/2, 14 rows in total) + 3 zero-hit + 2 with no public tool (labour & social insurance; listing/review status); `evidence/calls.jsonl` is **9 rows** (seq 1–9 chain continuous, all eight fields present; domain split disclosure_cn 8 + fr_fact_index 1), with the tail row seq=9 booking the category 其他已披露重大事项 on domain disclosure_cn at hits=2 (field listing, not a verbatim quotation); **Snapshots, booked at three points in time** (quoted verbatim from the artifact: 「三分时点定账:首跑支撑 3、reg 后补 1、现档共 13。」): 12 archived during the first run = 9 referenced by the flow + 3 support files (list-366d x1 + statute probes x2); 1 real snapshot back-filed late on 2026-09-23 — `regulatory_cn-snap-late-0923.json`; **13 on disk now**, by domain disclosure_cn 9 / fr_fact_index 1 / statute 2 / regulatory_cn 1 — plus the LEDGER and 14 `sources.jsonl` records. The 2026-09-23 revision of this section said only "12": the number was not wrong, the **time point before the late filing simply was not labeled**; the same-day revision added the time points and the expiry condition below. **When this sentence expires**: if the run is executed again with everything archived in one pass, or if any further file is added, this three-point account is void and the sentence must be rewritten. **The multi-domain set form (§v2-16②) now works on a real deliverable**: the 财务与披露质量 row books `disclosure_cn、fr_fact_index`, and ledger cell, flow domain set and per-domain raw snapshots are all three in place; in the same artifact the 合规与处罚 regulatory snapshot was **not archived during the first run**: the ledger note now reads verbatim in two fragments: 「reg 快照首跑未打」 plus 「现档 regulatory_cn-snap-late-0923.json 为 2026-09-23 迟交补真件、不入本类流水」 (the parenthetical in between is an in-artifact correction mark and is not quoted here) — the real file was late-dated on 2026-09-23, and the first run's history is not rewritten; the flow-domain rule is unchanged (the ledger cell books only `disclosure_cn`, otherwise that category's domain set could not match the flow — which is the legitimate way to complete a domain set). **When this sentence expires**: only if the run is executed again and the regulatory face is archived inside that first run. Statutory derivation: both statute probes returned unrelated rules → **derivation refused on the spot, no row written** (this state re-confirmed once more; the reason line is in the ledger); **this run has no downgrade rows**, quoted verbatim from the ledger: 「无降级行:九类中四类 N=M」 plus 「检到 4 类=股 6/关 4/财 2/其 2」 (that line carries the source-side correction mark with the wrong figure struck through; this package switched back from paraphrase to quotation on 2026-09-23). Consumption, quoted verbatim from `progress.md` as two separate entries: 「首跑(09-23 07:0x)直查 12 次=search 8+fr 1+list 1+statute 2,零计费,research 0、omni 0」 and 「补真档一笔(09-23 10:3x reg 快照 1 次)另记为迟交件,两笔不合账不互冒」 — the 14-calls figure this section carried before the 2026-09-23 revision came from the pre-correction self-report (it counted a regulatory call the first run never made); the two entries are kept apart and never pooled. A 12m window does not touch the long-window declaration face — cross-checking the category retrieval ceiling against reachable evidence remains an internal open item, and this run claims nothing about long-window coverage.
- **Still unverified**: all runs are the same single issuer — investment (12m), credit (24m) and `mna` (12m, the current-gate PASS credential above); **no second issuer has been run at all**, multi-issuer input is refused by contract, the wider windows for `mna` and `investment` have not been run, and longer windows are bounded by the domain-side search window (tracked internally: declared window vs. reachable evidence cannot yet be machine-cross-checked); whether and when the package reaches a marketplace is decided outside it, and these documents state no such status. **What the wide-window run evidences (§v2-11 ruling)**: that run predates §v2-11 — it only shows a wide window can complete the seven-step pipeline. Re-scanned with the current gate it FAILS with three findings (a missing age-declaration line → `DD-COVERAGE`, plus the same two-domain under-booking under §v2-16② → `DD-OMISSION`), so it is neither long-window coverage evidence for `disclosure_cn` (that category's known retrieval ceiling is 365 days, i.e. the coverage gap tracked internally) nor a PASS credential. Axes stated explicitly: purpose axis investment / credit / mna, one run each; window axis 12m twice and 24m once, nothing wider; subject axis a single issuer throughout. Outside these three back-filled instances, no other "N items found" number appears anywhere in this README.
- **Release surface**: whether and when this package reaches any skill marketplace, and when it is pushed or published, is decided outside the package — these documents state no such status (a static document would rot). Repo visibility is governed by the root README and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Known edges**: one subject per run (more than one is refused); no market-data feed; the statutory-derivation path expects zero anchors as of 2026-09-23; social-insurance detail, full pending-litigation and full administrative-fine data have no public tool — these live only in the coverage ledger, never in an assertion.

## 10. Provenance

- Base: anthropics/financial-services `dd-checklist` and `deal-screening` (Apache-2.0) — origin of the diligence-checklist task shape and the screening tiers.
- This package is an **A-share re-implementation, not a port**: the data layer is fully Cue-native; the nine categories, first gate, coverage ledger and fail-closed evidence rule are rebuilt to this suite's contracts. No code from the base. See the repo-root `NOTICE.md`.
