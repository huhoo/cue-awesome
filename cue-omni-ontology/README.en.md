# cue-omni-ontology

**Turn public documents into business knowledge you can update and check.**

Give an agent two releases or reports. Receive **evidenced answers, a searchable change brief with source excerpts, and a reusable knowledge package** for the next update. Start with disclosure tracking, public supplier diligence, or product/competitor monitoring.

**English companion of `README.md` (Chinese primary; repo-local reference — channel pages do not resolve relative links).** beta · Python standard-library tools · No usage telemetry

## See the value

[Microsoft public-disclosure example](assets/public-example/live-preview.md): a fresh parse-to-answer run, including extraction, build/update and evidence queries.

| Your question | What the skill provides |
|---|---|
| Why are there two numbers for one metric? | Separate periods, units, bases and qualifiers, with each source. |
| Must I start over after the next report? | Update the existing package while retaining history, added support and conflicts. |
| Where did this conclusion come from? | Search the brief, expand verbatim excerpts and inspect original URLs/locators. |
| Can my next agent task reuse the work? | Structured knowledge and optional draft OKF core-subset export. |
| Can it take earnings-meeting video or audio? | Yes, as a **bounded local clips/splits (≤256 MiB)** workflow: three 90-second clips from two meetings completed the full chain (build→update×2→validate→query→export-okf) with 8/8 verbatim re-check hits; full-length meeting parsing is **not established** — five public full-length URL attempts were refused and a local full file is stopped by the 256 MiB gate. See `references/av-backtest.md`. |

Begin with one subject, 2–5 public sources and a concrete question. A complete enterprise ontology is not a prerequisite.

## First try: no API key

Ask your agent:

> Use cue-omni-ontology with its bundled demo. Show what a new release adds, where claims conflict, and how to inspect the evidence.

Or run one command from the skill directory (Python 3.10+):

```sh
python3 scripts/ontology.py demo --out /path/to/work/cue-demo
```

Replace the placeholder with a **new directory in your workspace**. Open `cue-demo/brief/brief.html`; no server is needed. Search, filter new/conflicting claims and expand excerpts. Hosts without HTML rendering can read adjacent `brief.md` / `brief.json`.

The example is fictional and makes zero API/network calls. Prior revenue 100 and a later comparative 105 remain conflicting; current revenue 120 and adjusted 115 stay separate; an unmentioned Alpha product is not inferred retired.

## Install and use your sources

```sh
npx skills add huhoo/cue-awesome --skill cue-omni-ontology
```

This install route requires Node.js/npm; copying this directory into your host's supported skills location is also possible. Offline tooling only needs Python. Real parsing uses official [cue-omni-reader](https://github.com/sensedeal/cue-skills/tree/main/cue-omni-reader); follow its [setup](https://github.com/sensedeal/cue-skills/blob/main/cue-omni-reader/references/setup.md) to connect MCP and configure credentials. This package does not install or configure Omni automatically. Keep keys in your secret facility, not chat or Issues.

Once connected, provide sources and ask:

```text
Use cue-omni-ontology to answer from these two public reports:
1. What is newly disclosed?
2. Which figures require separate bases before comparison?
3. What remains unsupported?
Give me a brief with expandable evidence and a package I can update next time.
```

Then reuse it:

```text
Add this new announcement to the existing package and produce a change brief.
Preserve old records and highlight conflicts. Missing mentions are not deletions.
```

See [task-recipes.md](references/task-recipes.md) for business tasks. Official Omni parses sources; the host model extracts semantics; offline tooling handles locators, versions, queries and briefs. Protocol compatibility is not certification of every host.

## Reduce mechanical extraction work

Agents can copy exact quotes instead of calculating hashes and UTF-8 offsets manually. See [quote-draft.json](assets/demo/quote-draft.json) and [quote-input.md](references/quote-input.md):

```sh
python3 scripts/ontology.py prepare assets/demo/quote-draft.json --out /path/to/work/prepared
python3 scripts/ontology.py build /path/to/work/prepared/input.json --out /path/to/work/v1
python3 scripts/ontology.py update assets/demo/r2.json --base /path/to/work/v1 --out /path/to/work/v2
python3 scripts/ontology.py brief /path/to/work/v2 --base /path/to/work/v1 --out /path/to/work/brief
python3 scripts/ontology.py catalog /path/to/work/v2 --kind changes
python3 scripts/ontology.py query /path/to/work/v2 --concept metric:revenue --period 2026Q1 --with-evidence
```

Repeated quotes require more context or an explicit occurrence. When the exact match fails, `prepare` retries once ignoring table pipes, whitespace and Markdown markers, yet the evidence still points at verbatim source bytes; anything still ambiguous fails, with no semantic fuzzy matching. Use `catalog` first to see the entities, concepts and conflicts in a package (each conflict carries verbatim excerpts for both sides); `query` rejects unknown fields instead of ignoring them. For `needs_scope`, choose a basis, unit, exact validity boundaries or returned fact ID. `--with-evidence` includes bounded verbatim previews and flags truncation. Matching is not semantic verification: inspect headers, footnotes and qualifications.

**Turn a real Omni result into a source**: save the parse call's structuredContent or complete JSON, then:

```sh
python3 scripts/ontology.py omni-source /path/to/work/omni/r1.json --out /path/to/work --id source:r1 --url "https://..." --title "..." --accessed-at 2026-10-07
```

It writes the parsed text byte-for-byte (checking Omni's sha256) and a source record with pages; paste it into draft.json and run `prepare`. Only source-PDF page anchors count and no page is guessed; it starts no parse, reads no key and spends no credits. Writing with `save_result` or keeping only Markdown loses the pages, so the tool refuses that by default.

**Optional numeric pack**: the host computes annual-report deltas, restatements and balance checks with deterministic code, and a model extracts only narrative items. `numeric-import` checks that every figure has unit, page and table id for both years and that excerpts are verbatim on the source page; `numeric` shows them in review order (drivers -> consequences -> explained-normal events). It does not score or warn. Credit-risk annual-report tasks extract the [fixed section set](references/credit-risk-sections.md).

## Deliverables and verification

- **Human entry point:** offline `brief.html`, Markdown counterpart, sources, scope distinctions, changes and excerpts.
- **Reusable knowledge:** `knowledge.json`, `sources.jsonl`, `changes.json`, `run.json` and exact source snapshots.
- **Extraction notes:** host-written `extraction-notes.md` records questions, gaps, failed sources and semantic review.
- **Optional interchange:** `export-okf` creates draft concepts targeting the OKF 0.2 core subset; external consumer imports need separate verification.

The [verification record](references/verification.md) distinguishes fresh parsing, saved-output replay, independent synthetic use and remaining limits. The [Microsoft run](references/live-verification.md) produced 21 source claims from two sources and retained all 11 baseline claims after updating. It demonstrates a bounded workflow, not general extraction accuracy or proven customer ROI. In the [holdout backtest](references/verification.md) (40 annual reports, 7,598 pages) evidence validity was clearly higher than two baselines, but root-cause ranking missed the pre-set pass bar and the early-warning claim was falsified; the three sets of numbers and the limits are stated together in the verification record.

Offline self-check:

```sh
python3 -B scripts/test_ontology.py
python3 -B scripts/test_numeric.py
```

## FAQ and anti-patterns (what you try -> declined, because -> where to go)

Authoritative text lives in `SKILL.md`, `references/knowledge-contract.md` and `references/update-policy.md`;
this table gathers it and does not restate it exhaustively.

| What you try | Declined? Why | Where instead |
|---|---|---|
| A newer source omits a fact, so treat it as withdrawn | **No.** The update policy states plainly that "not mentioned" is not deletion - silence is not negation | Record a change only when a filing withdraws or supersedes; otherwise keep the old object with its basis state |
| Reuse the same ID with a different meaning | **No.** The updater refuses same-ID meaning swaps; on definition or source ID conflict it keeps the old object, proposes a new ID and explains | Open a new ID for the new meaning, keep history, retain the conflict side by side |
| Have the script merge two values into one conclusion | **No.** The knowledge package stores **directly disclosed assertions** only; computation and judgement belong in the answer with inputs named | Keep conflicts visible in the brief (100 and 105 coexist); no silent overwrite |
| Describe `ontology.py` as an automatic extractor | **Not true.** Division of labour is fixed: the official parser reads material, the **host model does semantic extraction**, offline tools check structure and consistency | Write `extraction-notes.md` covering scope, failed sources and manual review |
| Assume a public-looking URL is reachable | **No.** URL shape proves nothing about public accessibility; retrieval supplements only inside authorised research scope, no crawler | Use files or links the user explicitly provides, or fetch through Cue channels and keep snapshots |
| Pipe `export-okf` straight into an external system | **Untested.** Export is a draft targeting the OKF 0.2 core subset; consumer compatibility is verified separately | Verify on the consuming side first; this package promises only the shape it emits |
| Check a sentence or figure against the filing page by page, or get a lead piece with page citations | **Not this package's job.** This package builds updatable knowledge packages, change briefs and the numeric pack | [cue-lead-pieces](../cue-lead-pieces/README.en.md) in this repository: quote verification and lead pieces |
| Use the numeric pack or change brief as a default early warning or automatic risk discovery | **No.** The holdout backtest falsified the early-warning claim and root-cause ranking missed the pass bar; the ordering is a review order | A person judges from the verbatim evidence; see the [verification record](references/verification.md) |

## When something goes wrong (symptom -> cause -> recovery)

**Whatever is absent from this run's tool output is written as "not found"**: a parameter, field or enum value that does not appear there must not be filled from memory - write "not found" and log it on the pending or coverage list; a blank never stands in for it.
Written from the **current actual output** of `scripts/ontology.py` (real runs): verification commands print **one JSON
line**. Success looks like `{"status": "valid", "counts": {...}, "semantic_verification": "not_established_by_scripts"}`
(exit 0); failure looks like `{"status": "invalid", "error": "<cause>"}` (exit 2, on stderr); a missing subcommand or
argument prints the argparse usage and exits 2.

| Symptom | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `{"status": "invalid", "error": "knowledge integrity mismatch"}` | Package content no longer matches its integrity record (`knowledge.json` hand-edited, or objects swapped under one ID) | Do not hand-edit package files: re-run `build` / `update` from sources; if a revision is truly needed, open a new ID and keep the old record |
| `{"status": "invalid", "error": "source hash mismatch: <source ID>"}` | The stored snapshot disagrees with the recorded hash (source text changed or was replaced) | Re-parse that source into a new snapshot and a new run; keep the old snapshot, never rewrite history |
| `{"status": "invalid", "error": "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '<path>'"}` | The path handed to `validate` is not a complete package directory (one of `knowledge.json` / `run.json` / `changes.json` missing) | Point at the directory `build` emitted; `demo` output lives in version subdirectories such as `<out>/v1`, `<out>/v2` |
| Messages shaped like `<label>: invalid ID`, `<label>: duplicate ID <key>`, `duplicate JSON key: <key>`, `invalid value for <type>` | Structure or value violates the contract (ID regex, duplicate keys, value type) | Fix per the field spec in `references/knowledge-contract.md`, then re-run the same validate |
| `usage: ontology.py [-h] {build,update,validate,query,catalog,export-okf,feedback,review,numeric-import,numeric,omni-source,prepare,brief,demo} ...` plus `error: the following arguments are required: command` | No subcommand, or a required parameter was skipped | Run `python3 scripts/ontology.py <subcommand> --help` first (e.g. `demo` requires `--out`, and **the output directory must be new**) |
| `omni-source`: `not JSON. Plain Markdown (or text written by save_result) has no grounding sidecar` | You saved Markdown or text written by `save_result`; the pages are gone | Save the parse call's structuredContent or complete JSON; if text is all you have, pass `--text-only` (no pages) |
| `omni-source`: `the result has no source-PDF page anchors` | The result is detail=text, has rendered-page anchors only, or is not a PDF | Pass `--text-only` to package with text ranges; a grounded re-parse is billed, so ask the user first |
| `omni-source`: `Omni status is failed SOURCE_ACCESS_DENIED` / `DETAIL_CAPABILITIES_UNAVAILABLE` | Omni cannot fetch that URL (measured for SEC EDGAR), or this Bridge cannot do grounded parsing of a local file (measured on 1.8.3) | Note it in the coverage statement; obtain the text yourself and package it with `manual_page` or text ranges, never as Omni pages |
| `omni-source`: `does not match its sha256 digest`, or `read_result(...)` expired | An artifact read came back incomplete, or the Bridge-local result expired | Read again; after expiry a re-parse may be billed, so ask the user first |
| `numeric-import`: `excerpt is not verbatim on FY<year> p<page>` / `page not in sources` | The excerpt is not the page's text, or the page is missing from `FY<year>.pages.jsonl` | Copy the excerpt from the source page and check the page; do not reformat numbers |
| Validation passes yet the extraction is semantically wrong | Scripts check structure and consistency only - the field `semantic_verification` literally reads `not_established_by_scripts`; scripts do not prove semantics | Review line by line with `review` and the expandable-source brief. That division is the design, not a defect |
| Want to confirm the tool itself works | — | Local self-checks: `python3 -B scripts/test_ontology.py` and `python3 -B scripts/test_numeric.py` (listed under Deliverables and verification; test count comes from the run itself) |

## How to ask (positive examples and one counter-example)

**Ask with a point in time; the output states its source date**: give the reporting period, reference date or look-back window in the request; the deliverable labels its **source date** on the first line, and when that differs from the date you asked about, the text never says "today" or "latest" - it reads "as of <date>".
- **Positive (first try, no credentials)**: "Use cue-omni-ontology with its bundled demo: once new material is added,
  which facts are new, which conflict, and where is the basis?" - or one command,
  `python3 scripts/ontology.py demo --out <a brand-new working directory>`: no network, no parse API, and it emits a
  brief whose evidence expands to source text.
- **Positive (two real documents)**: "Answer from these two public reports: (1) what disclosure is new; (2) which
  numbers differ in basis and must not be compared directly; (3) which questions lack support. Give me a brief with
  expandable sources and save an updatable knowledge package." - the template in Install and use your sources; sources
  and task handles are kept separately, and the output directory must be new.
- **Positive (complex: a second update with boundary demands)**: "Add this new announcement to the existing package and
  give me the change brief. Keep old records, highlight conflicts needing review, and **do not treat 'not mentioned' as
  deletion**; unit, period, basis, exclusions and validity go into the fact layer - do not merge them into one number
  for me." - exactly what the updater enforces under update-policy: refuse same-ID meaning swaps, keep conflicts,
  deduplicate identical statements.
- **Positive (English phrasing)**: this package's frontmatter trigger set is already bilingual
  (`ontology extraction` / `disclosure tracking` / `evidence briefs` / `numeric pack` / `知识包` / `变化简报`),
  so either language can open it.
- **Counter-example (adjacent need, not this skill)**: "which of these two companies is stronger, give me a verdict" -
  the decision-shaped evidence chain belongs to `competitive-brief`; "lay out anchor-bound public risk facts for this
  listed issuer and account for what could not be checked" - `dd-checklist`; "translate this foreign book, then index
  it" - `long-doc-translation`. This package turns public material into an updatable, verifiable knowledge package plus
  change briefs.

## Domestically reachable evidence paths (when overseas sites do not load)

The offline tools (`ontology.py`, `numeric.py`, `omni_source.py` and the two tests) depend only on the Python standard library, and **demo mode needs
no API key and makes no network call** - so "let me see what this is" has no extra barrier in a domestic environment.
When actually gathering material, three paths already exist in this package:

1. **Files the user provides come first.** PDF, HTML or plain text can enter parsing and the knowledge package directly -
   no overseas site needed. Domestic public material (exchange and disclosure-platform announcements, vendor Chinese
   sites and documentation portals, industry-association reports, WeChat public-account articles) is most reliable here.
2. **If an overseas site will not load, do not route around it.** Have the page **exported to a file by the user** and
   hand that to the parse channel. This package builds no crawler and never assumes reachability from URL shape.
3. **Supplementary retrieval stays inside authorised research scope** via the host's retrieval tools; whatever comes
   back keeps its snapshot and provenance.

None of the three changes the deliverable shape: the package still stores only directly disclosed assertions, conflicts
stay side by side, snapshots and hashes remain re-checkable, and every source records its ID and parse date. A source
that cannot be obtained is marked "not obtained" - **no inference, no silent overwrite**. That is the same discipline
as update-policy; a restricted network does not loosen it. This section promises no unopened data domain and no
promise that a specific site will load.

## Feedback that matters

**Did your own documents answer your question? Would you add the next release? Where did correction still take effort?** These signals are more useful than download counts.

`feedback PACKAGE --out NEW_FILE` creates a local draft. Review it and decide whether to submit a [public issue](https://github.com/huhoo/cue-awesome/issues/new); nothing is uploaded automatically. Share private material, contacts and business context through a separately agreed private channel.

For internal-document monitoring, downstream agents/ERP/CRM, domain schema review or full on-prem deployment, describe the **task, update frequency, current review effort and target workflow**. These are discovery topics, not production capabilities already delivered by this public skill.

## Boundaries and license

Store directly reported claims; disclose inputs for derived calculations and judgments in answers. The audio/video capability is bounded, not blanket: "includes audio/video" holds only under the "bounded local clips/splits (≤256 MiB)" workflow (the What this decides section of `references/av-backtest.md` is the single source of this wording); the verbatim re-check proves excerpt-to-parser consistency, i.e. integrity, not semantic truth. Definitions remain candidates; local review records do not provide enterprise IAM or operational authorization. Cloud parsing of a local file is not full on-prem deployment.

Briefs include bounded source excerpts; complete packages contain parsed text. Check source conditions and authorization before sharing. Code/docs are [MIT](LICENSE); public access is not blanket permission to redistribute entire reports. The Chinese README is canonical user documentation; `SKILL.md` (Chinese-first) is the canonical agent entry, with `SKILL.en.md` as its synchronized translation. Judgements are the scripts as they now stand; fixtures evidence only the cases they actually run, not an exhaustive claim.
